		"Markdown": "# Wiki Syntax Guide\n___\n## Complete Syntax Reference\n> Below is every formatting option supported by this wiki.\n___\n| **Feature** | **Syntax (Remove Spaces)** | **Description** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **BOLD** | `**Text**` | Wrap text in double asterisks. |\n| **ITALIC** | `*Text*` | Wrap text in single asterisks. |\n| **STRIKE** | `~~Text~~` | Wrap text in double tildes. |\n| **CODE** | `Text` | Wrap text in backticks. |\n| **HEADER** | `# Title` | Use 1 to 6 hashtags. Must be at start of line. |\n| **LIST** | `* Item` | Use an asterisk or hyphen. Must be at start of line. |\n| **QUOTE** | `> Text` | Use a greater-than sign. Must be at start of line. |\n| **DIVIDER** | `___` | Three underscores create a line. |\n| **LINK (Web)** | `[Name](https://url.com)` | Standard web link. |\n| **LINK (Wiki)** | `[[PageName]]` | Links to another Wiki Node. |\n| **LINK (Named)**| `[Home](wiki:Home) ` | Links to a Node with custom text. |\n| **IMG (Full)** | `[img] URL` | Full size image. |\n| **IMG (Icon)** [imgi]http://i.imgur.com/6hstCd5.png  | `[imgi] URL` | **Icon Size:** Resizes to 32px width. |\n| **IMG (Small)** | `[imgs] URL` | **Small:** Resizes to 25% width. |\n| **IMG (Med)** | `[imgm] URL` | **Medium:** Resizes to 50% width. |\n___\n\n## How to Create Tables\nTo create a table, wrap your text in pipes `|`.\n1. The **First Row** is always the Header (Dark background, Red text).\n2. The **Second Row** is the separator (e.g., `|---|`). The script hides  this row automatically.\n3. **Subsequent Rows** are your data.\n\n`| Item | Cost |`\n`|---|---|`\n`| Sword | 100 |`\n\n___\n\n## Important Notes & Hints\n\n**Headers & Lists inside Tables:**\n* You cannot use Headers (`#`) or Lists (`*`) **inside** a table cell. The script only detects these if they are at the very start of a new line. Inside a table, the line starts with `|`, so they will be ignored.\n* *Workaround:* Use **Bold** inside tables instead of Headers.\n\n**Code Blocks & Escaping:**\n* **Note:** Markdown formatting is **disabled** inside code blocks.\n* **Protected Text:** `**Bold**` will appear exactly as `**Bold**`, not bold.\n* **Protected Links:** `[[Link]]` will appear as text, not a clickable link.\n\n**Internal Wiki Linking:**\n* To link between pages within this dashboard, use the exact **Name** of the node.\n* **Quick Link:** Wrap the node name in double brackets: `[[Home]]`\n* **Custom Text Link:** Use the `wiki:` prefix: `[Click Here](wiki:Home)`\n\n**Image Formats:**\n* The script supports direct URLs (e.g., `https://i.imgur.com/example.png`).\n*   `[imgi]` is perfect for item icons inside tables.\n*   `[imgs]` is good for side-by-side screenshots.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n*   **Table Formatting:** If your table looks broken, ensure the second row contains only dashes and pipes (e.g., `|---|---|`).\n*   **Images Not Loading:** Ensure the URL is a direct link to the image file (ending in `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.), not a link to a gallery page.\n*   **Raw HTML:** HTML tags (like `<b>`) are disabled for security; use the Markdown syntax instead."

Some people such as strong mages, blacksmiths, professors, scientists, adventurers, treasure hunters, miners and soldiers have remained on the island after the incident on Cardia, because they do not want to give up the place and eventually all Madrigal would be in danger!\n\n**In Cardia you can expect a lot of content such as a longer story quest, group quests, daily quests, daily group boss monsters, treasures, resources, secrets and puzzles, which must be solved!**\n**There are also three group dungeons on this island, two of them are available at a certain level of progress. One of these dungeons will be unlocked for you in another future patch!**\n**The requirements for Cardia, however, is that you have at least one Soulreaver set & weapon that is heavily upgraded, because the monsters and creatures take absolutely no damage with other weapons! The Soulreaver Items seems to have a special power...**\n**In Cardia you can expect a story quest (one-time), some one-time hunt quests, which can be done alone or as a group and daily quests of which you always get 10 random ones every day, which can be done quickly.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FFUQsuZO.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=23a8c40e&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fxk5Ot93.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=79a6f672&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FuaDWBNO.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=5a3d51f3&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FaednDK0.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=67b894ae&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FrGxU6Gi.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=2bc25fe5&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FsVICZvl.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=5ed4fdd2&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FmRIskuZ.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=b0b7a1a&sv=2\n**Over 250+ New Monster with every location ( Small Preview )**\n***Cardia, Dungeons, Open World Dungeons, Level Maps**\n**Cardia - Wilds ( Small Preview )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FaVr2oas.gif&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=e32edc8c&sv=2\n**Cardia - Dragon Thunder Valley ( Small Preview )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSZoYz4W.gif&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=66d437c8&sv=2\n**Cardia - Snowland ( Small Preview )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FWzP5YAf.gif&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=6668dcf6&sv=2\n**Cardia - Cave ( Small Preview )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FgAotSsN.gif&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=760fe3a7&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FmRIskuZ.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=b0b7a1a&sv=2\n**New Open World - Boss Monster with new Mechanics**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FGLi2W7o.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=29d86e46&sv=2\n**Hunt the new boss monsters as a group, which are roaming on the island of Cardia.**\n**These are for Special Daily Quests of which you will receive 6 random ones every day!**\n**More than 20+ special boss monsters on the island are waiting for you!*\n**Open World - Boss ( Preview 1 out of 20+ New Boss Monster )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F8oT4ZTx.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=50150248&sv=2\n**Open World - Boss ( Preview 2 out of 20+ New Boss Monster )**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F8RtP2Y1.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=1270e719&sv=2\n**Open World - Mechanics / Pattern in different Areas!

We have a Platinum Level system that can be increased up to level 175 and 99.99% experience by using Platinum Level scrolls. These scrolls can be obtained for free or from an NPC in Flaris. Platinum levels do not provide additional stats, but players will receive items that give stats such as Stat Pets or Accessories for their character. Platinum Level 50 is the highest level that can be achieved through leveling. Players can reach higher levels by completing daily quests, activities, and dungeons. Reaching higher Platinum levels will also unlock additional rewards from the Donate Shop or valuable chests. With the \"Myths of Cardia\" patch, we introduced the Royal Level system for our endgame players. This system works similarly to the Platinum Level system, but increasing the Royal Level unlocks more game content (2 new level maps and a large zone with different biomes) and strengthens the character with new stats. The Royal Level system has a very low experience rate, but it can be increased through EXP items and occasional Royal EXP events.\n**If anyone is wondering how leveling works for new players:****Please also check our**[Beginner Guide](new-players/beginner-guide.html)****-> Reach level 175.\n-> Platinum level in various areas and receive platinum rewards that strengthen the character.\n-> From Platinum 40, the EXP curve is significantly lowered.\n-> P50 is the last platinum level.\n-> All further platinum levels above P50 are just bonuses that can be leveled through tasks and dungeons.\n-> After reaching Platinum 50, the new Royal Level System is introduced, which is built on a low rate but can also be increased with power-ups.\n-> Obtain Soulreaver weapons / equipment because otherwise, no damage can be done to the Royal Monsters.\n-> RL. 0 to 1 = Complete quests (1-2h)\n-> RL. 1 to 6 = Leveling (A bit longer)\n-> RL. 6 to 10 = Complete quests (1-3 days depending on playtime / whether you quest solo or in a group)\n-> Get Royal equipment / weapons which can be worn from RL. 10.\n-> RL. 10 to 15 = Longer leveling, but can be postponed unless one wants to unlock the Trance Mode / Soulreaver Power-Up.\n-> RL. 15 to 20 = Longer Leveling on the best Penya Farm Map, where you can get additional Items and access to two of the RL. 15 Dungeons.\n\n**Drop Rate: 8000x (Custom in Mid / Endgame - So that it's not to much)**In addition to our balancements and existing drops and rates, we have added numerous new drops and items throughout Madrigal and our custom content.\nMany dungeons are also designed so that you can farm the respective currency from the regular monsters to obtain something.\n\n**Penya Rate: 4000x**Our revised currency system offers a wide range of possibilities for earning and spending Penya. While the rate may seem overpowered at first, players will be surprised by the numerous opportunities available to them.\nJob classes that play as 1-on-1 receive double the amount of Penya per killed monster compared to job classes that use AoE skills for farming. This is because AoE classes can acquire very high Penya amounts, and we want to give something back to 1-on-1 players. Despite receiving half the amount per monster, AoE classes farm faster because they can kill multiple monsters in a shorter amount of time.\n\n**Last Content Patch:**[**https://bit.ly/3HFTpY6**](https://bit.ly/3HFTpY6)**Current Class Balance:**[**https://bit.ly/3gxkSjs**](https://bit.ly/3gxkSjs)*****Scroll down for Stat Pictures***Beginner Guide:**[Beginner Guide](new-players/beginner-guide.html)",

			"description": "**If you are experiencing a texture or different error when using the current version of Entropia and do not have the required file in your client, you can try the following steps to fix the issue:**\n1. Download and fully unpack the game again.\n2. Install the necessary graphics drivers, specifically DirectX 9.0c, which can be found in the Entropia\\DirectX folder. To do this, locate the DXSETUP.exe file and run it.\n\nor Download it here:\n• DirectX (9.0c) End-User Runtimes (June 2010):****[**Microsoft Download**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)\n3. If the error persists, it is possible that your antivirus is blocking certain functions of the game due to our use of the \"VMProtect\" (VMProtect is a software protection system designed to protect applications and libraries from reverse engineering, tampering, and cracking). To fix this, add an exception for the Entropia folder or specifically for the neuz.exe files in the Entropia\\bin32 and Entropia\\bin64 directories in your antivirus settings.\n**It can be that you need to restart your Computer after that, because it can be buggy with some antivirus programs, that they still block them, even after you excluded the files in your Antivirus.\n\nGuides to add exceptions:**• **Windows-Defender:** [https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj](https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj)\n• **Avira:** [https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG](https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG)\n• **Avast:** [https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt](https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt)\n• **Bitdefender:** [https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn](https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn)\n• **McAfee:** [https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4](https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4)\n\nMake an Exception for:\nEntropia (Whole Folder)\nEntropia\\Launcher.exe\nEntropia\\Updater.exe\nEntropia\\bin32\\Neuz.exe\nEntropia\\bin64\\Neuz.exe\n\nIt can be that you need to restart your Computer after that.\n\nIt may also be helpful to re-download the game, not launch it yet, and first add the exceptions in your antivirus software.

			"description": "**Question:**\nMy game remains white at startup even though an exception was added to the antivirus. What should I do?\n\n**Answer:**There could be several reasons for this issue. It could be due to an outdated client, lack of read/write access to the Entropia client folder, or missing drivers. Some operating systems also block certain paths such as the download folder, which is only intended for downloads. Therefore, try moving your Entropia client to the desktop or to C:\\Programs.\nIf the issue persists, right-click on the Entropia folder and select \"Properties\" followed by the \"Security\" tab. Check if the permissions for \"Read\" and \"Write\" have check marks. If not, edit them and give the folder full access so that Windows can use it without any problems.\nIf the issue still persists, try patching your game via the patcher/launcher but do not start the game through it. Instead, close the patcher/launcher and delete the following files in your client **if** they exist - normaly they should not be there:\n• d3d9.dll in the Entropia\\bin32 and Entropia\\bin64 folder.\n• d3dx9_43.dll in the Entropia\\bin32 and Entropia\\bin64 folder.\nAfter deleting these files, start the game using the **start_64bit.bat** or **start_32bit.bat** file located in your client folder. This ensures that the game can be started without the patcher/launcher.\n\nAlso make sure that you have the required drivers installed for our game:\n• Visual C++ Redistributable Packages 2015 / 2017:****[**Microsoft Download**](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)\n• DirectX (9.0c) End-User Runtimes (June 2010):****[**Microsoft Download**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)\nLastly, it's worth checking if an exception for Entropia has been added to your antivirus software. If not, add it to the exception list to prevent the antivirus from blocking any necessary files.\n**If you're still experiencing issues, please read through this section:**[**Click me!**](my-game-does-not-launch.html)****\n**Please also make sure that your folder looks like this and that you have downloaded it again & use a fresh game client:**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FvYTDgx6.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=fe2edcf3&sv=2\nMake sure that your game folder looks like this!",

		"Ghost DCs / Bad Ping": {
			"description": "Ghost DCs (Disconnections) in games refer to instances where players are disconnected from the game server without any apparent reason, usually due to network latency, packet loss, or other connectivity issues. This can be quite frustrating, as it can disrupt the gameplay experience and, in some cases, even result in penalties or loss of progress. Here's a tutorial on how to add a game as an exception in your windows firewall and how using a VPN can help with reducing your ping if you live far away from the game server:\n**Adding the game as an exception in your firewall:**\nFirewall software can sometimes interfere with the connection between your game and the game server. To prevent this, you can add the game as an exception in your firewall settings.\n**a. For Windows Firewall:**\nCopy\n1. Open the Control Panel by searching for it in the Start menu.\n2. Click on \"System and Security,\" then \"Windows Defender Firewall.\"\n3. On the left pane, click \"Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.\"\n4. Click \"Change settings\" and then \"Allow another app.\"\n5. Browse for the game executable file (usually found in the game's installation folder) and click \"Open.\"\n6. Ensure both \"Private\" and \"Public\" boxes are checked, then click \"OK.\"\n**b. For third-party firewall software (VPNs, Servers):**\nCopy\nThe process will vary depending on the software you are using.Please refer to the specific instructions provided by the software's developer.\n**Using a VPN to improve connectivity:**\nIf you live far away from the game server, latency and packet loss can become significant issues. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can help by routing your connection through a server that is closer to the game server, thereby reducing latency and improving overall connection stability.\nWe recommend to use the ExitLag VPN, which most of our Players use, but you can also try out a different one. ExitLag VPN also has a Free 3-Day Trial!\na. Choose a reputable VPN provider with servers in the region where the game server is located (France). b. Install the VPN software on your computer. c. Launch the VPN and connect to a server in the desired region. d. Start your game and check for improvements in latency and overall connection stability.\nPlease note that while a VPN can help in certain situations, it may not always result in better performance. Some game servers may even block or restrict VPN connections (Entropia Allows it), so it's essential to verify that the VPN you are using is compatible with the game you are playing.\nBy following these steps, you can potentially reduce the occurrence of Ghost DCs in your gaming experience, leading to a smoother and more enjoyable time while playing.\n**If the disconnections in Entropia still persist, try to add Entropia as an exception in your Antivirus:\n\nGuides to add exceptions:**• **Windows-Defender:** [https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj](https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj)\n• **Avira:** [https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG](https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG)\n• **Avast:** [https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt](https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt)\n• **Bitdefender:** [https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn](https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn)\n• **McAfee:** [https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4](https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4)\n\nMake an Exception for:\nEntropia (Whole Folder)\nEntropia\\Launcher.exe\nEntropia\\Updater.exe\nEntropia\\bin32\\Neuz.exe\nEntropia\\bin64\\Neuz.exe\n\nIt can be that you need to restart your Computer after that.\n\nIt may also be helpful to re-download the game, not launch it yet, and first add the exceptions in your antivirus software.

It's always a good idea to do some research and test the game in the virtual environment before committing to it.\n\nAlso make sure that you have the required drivers installed on your virtual machine:\n• Visual C++ Redistributable Packages 2015 / 2017:****[**Microsoft Download**](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)\n• DirectX (9.0c) End-User Runtimes (June 2010):****[**Microsoft Download**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)\nThey are also located to install in your Entropia Folder under Entropia\\Drivers and Entropia\\DirectX\\DXSETUP.exe\n\nTo get Windows games running on a Mac, I still recommend doing some own research or watching some tutorial videos.\n**Once Entropia is successfully installed on your MacOS Machine, we need to make sure the user accounts are enabled / whitelisted so that the accounts can log in to our game client in the login window. Please create a ticket on our Discord for that step!**",

		"Bugsplat / Crashes": {
			"description": "As a player, if you frequently encounter Bugsplats (client crashes), it's important to submit the Bugsplat reports with your name included, so the developers can investigate the issue. Additionally, it's recommended to try the following steps to potentially resolve the problem:\n1. **Completely reinstall the game client:**This can help eliminate any issues caused by older client folders or missing files, as these are common causes for multiple client crashes.\n2. **Install the appropriate drivers for your hardware:**Ensure that your computer's drivers, especially for your graphics card, are up-to-date, as outdated drivers can cause compatibility issues and crashes.\n3. **Check if the game functions properly with the reinstalled client and updated drivers:**This will help you determine if the previous crashes were caused by the older client or missing files.\n4. **Restart your computer:**After completing the above steps, it's always a good idea to restart your computer to ensure that any changes made are fully applied and any potential lingering issues are resolved.\nBy following these steps, you can minimize the occurrence of Bugsplats and improve the stability of your gaming experience.",

			"description": "1. **Adjust your game settings:**a. Start by launching the game and accessing its settings menu (Start -> Options). b. Look for graphics or performance settings, and set the resolution, texture quality, and other options according to your hardware capabilities. If you have a powerful CPU and GPU, setting the options to High might help fully utilize your system, while a weaker system might require lower settings for better performance.\n2. **Optimize Windows power settings:**a. Right-click on the battery icon in the system tray (bottom right corner) and select \"Power Options.\" b. In the Power Options window, choose the \"High Performance\" plan. If it's not visible, click on \"Show additional plans\" to reveal it. c. Close the window. This will ensure that your computer's power settings do not throttle your game performance.\n3. **Update your graphics drivers:**a. Visit your GPU manufacturer's website (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) and download the latest graphics drivers for your specific model. b. Install the drivers and restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n4. **Optimize your GPU settings:**a. Open your GPU's control panel (NVIDIA Control Panel, AMD Radeon Settings, or Intel Graphics Control Panel). b. Locate the settings related to gaming or 3D applications, and adjust them for better performance. For example, you may want to enable \"Prefer Maximum Performance\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel or \"High Performance\" in AMD Radeon Settings.\n5. **Disable unnecessary background processes:**a. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager. b. Click on the \"Processes\" tab, and sort the list by CPU or memory usage. c. Carefully close any non-essential processes that are consuming significant resources.\n6. **Adjust in-game settings:**As mentioned earlier, setting the game options to High instead of Low can help fully utilize your CPU. This is particularly true for systems with powerful CPUs and GPUs, as running the game on low settings might cause the CPU to wait for the GPU, resulting in lower overall performance. Experiment with different settings to find the best balance between performance and visual quality for your specific hardware.\nBy following these steps, you can optimize your gaming experience and achieve the best possible performance based on your computer hardware. Remember that every game and system is different, so you may need to tweak these recommendations to match your unique setup.\n**Entropia** is a One core CPU-based game with some quirks (and the drawbacks that come with being a One core CPU-based game). Although the performance in Entropia has been significantly improved, the older base code of the game prevents a massive overhaul. As a result, particularly in cities with many players, frame (FPS) drops may occur due to the Glow effects (SFX) that need to be loaded and rendered. This process consumes a lot of performance, as it is only handled by a single core of your CPU.\nA One core CPU-based game like this can suffer from performance issues because it relies heavily on a single core of the processor to handle most of the game's tasks. This means that even if you have a multi-core processor, the game won't take full advantage of the additional cores, resulting in limited performance improvements. Consequently, players might experience slowdowns, especially in areas where there is a high concentration of players and visual effects, such as cities.\nOtherwise, for some locations, you can permanently, temporarily, or partially hide players, pets, and glow effects in your in-game options to achieve more frames (FPS).\nAdditionally, you can **use the keybinding Ctrl + P to toggle hiding and displaying players** if you experience lag in crowded areas with many players.",

		"Client Unpack Issues": {
			"description": "**You get an error message when unpacking?**\nUnpack the Game with [**WinRar**](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=1) or [**7Zip**](https://www.7-zip.org/) and don't use the standard Windows Unpacker!\n\n**To ensure a smooth installation, please make sure to properly unpack the game using either 7zip or WinRar. Avoid using the default Windows unpacker, as this may cause errors. To unpack the game, simply right-click on the Entropia.zip file and select \"Extract with 7zip\" or \"Extract with WinRar\".**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fx6SzDLs.png&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=b43f1dcf&sv=2\nExample error message!\nWhen downloading a large game client, you may find that the standard unzipping software on your computer struggles to unpack the files. This is due to the file size being too large for the standard software to handle. In this tutorial, we'll explore why this happens and demonstrate how to use alternative programs like 7-Zip or WinRAR to unpack the game client. We will focus on 7-Zip, as the game client was originally compressed using this software.\n1. Why Standard Unzipping Software Struggles with Large Game Clients: Standard unzipping software, like the built-in Windows extraction tool, can struggle to unpack large game client files for several reasons:a. Memory limitations: These programs are designed for simple tasks and may not have the memory capacity to handle large files. b. File size limitations: Some standard unzipping software may impose a file size limit, preventing the extraction of large game clients. c. Compatibility issues: The game client might have been compressed using a different algorithm or format, making it difficult for the standard software to recognize and extract the files.\n2. The Benefits of Using 7-Zip or WinRAR: Using alternative software like 7-Zip or WinRAR can help you overcome these limitations:a. Better memory management: These programs are designed to handle larger files and use more efficient memory allocation techniques. b. No file size limitations: Both 7-Zip and WinRAR can handle large files, making them suitable for extracting large game clients. c. Compatibility: These programs can recognize a wider range of compression formats and algorithms, increasing the chances of successfully extracting the game client.\n3. Unpacking the Game Client with 7-Zip: Since the game client was compressed with 7-Zip, we will focus on using this software to unpack it.a. Download and install 7-Zip: Visit the 7-Zip website ([https://www.7-zip.org/](https://www.7-zip.org/)) and download the appropriate version for your system. Install the software by following the on-screen instructions.b. Locate the game client file: Find the compressed game client file on your computer. It should have a file extension like .7z or .zip.c. Right-click the game client file: After locating the file, right-click on it to bring up a context menu. In this menu, select '7-Zip' and then 'Extract Here' or 'Extract to \"folder_name\"'. This will start the extraction process.d. Wait for extraction to complete: Depending on the size of the game client and your computer's performance, this process may take some time. Be patient and wait for the extraction to finish.e. Run the game: Once the extraction is complete, navigate to the extracted folder and locate the game executable file (usually with a .exe extension). Double-click the file to launch the game.\nConclusion: If you encounter issues unpacking a large game client using the standard unzipping software on your computer, consider using alternative programs like 7-Zip or WinRAR. In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use 7-Zip to extract a large game client. By following these steps, you can successfully unpack and play your game without any issues.",

Here’s what you can do beyond Platinum Level 50:\n### Continue the Adventure\n* **Level Beyond Platinum Level 50:**Leveling up beyond Platinum Level 50 is optional. Continue to earn Activity EXP through diverse in-game activities to unlock new challenges and rewards.\n### How to Earn Activity EXP for P50+ ~ P100+\n* **Dungeon Runs:**Team up with friends or other players to conquer challenging dungeons.\n* **Complete Daily Quests:**Kebaria and Aurania are filled with daily quests that yield generous Activity EXP and rewards.\n* **Participate in Events:**Join server-side events like the Guild War for a unique chance to earn additional EXP and exclusive items.\n### Boost Your Progress\n* Take advantage of power-ups or buffs available during weekend events to speed up your Activity EXP gain.\n### Gear Up\n* **Farm Guild Activities:**Participate in activities like Battlegrounds or Guild Siege to get some goodies and Buffs.\n* **Join Dungeons:**Dive into custom content dungeons for exclusive gear and challenges.\nEmbark on this next phase of your journey with confidence. The path ahead is filled with opportunities to strengthen your character and forge lasting alliances. Ready, set, grind!\n## Equipment / Weapon Route\n* **Early:**Shiny Set / Weapons (Les Britannia / Abyssal Cove Dungeon)\n* **Midgame:**Black Shiny Set / Weapons (Kebaria / Aurania Map)\n* **Late Midgame:**Soulreaver Set / Weapons (Ethral / Trigrem)\n* **Endgame:**Royal Set / Weapons (Cardia & RL 10+ Dungeons)\nFrom Shiny onwards, you'll need the current set to reach the next weapon/equipment level. You'll then have to merge your Shiny with destroyed Black Shiny items to create a intact Black Shiny item part, which you can then wear for higher effects.\nThe bonus stats from the Shiny set won't be carried over when merging with a destroyed Black Shiny part.\nWhen merging Black Shiny with a destroyed Soulreaver item, the bonuses from the Black Shiny part will combine with the Soulreaver part, giving you two bonus stats on your new part.\nYou'll need the Soulreaver set and weapons if you're leveling up from Royal Level 0 to 10 yourself. Only with the Soulreaver weapons can you deal damage to the monsters!\nFor endgame Royal equipment, you won't need to merge your equipment anymore. The Soulreaver items can then be converted into a special HP & damage buff, which becomes stronger if you have good Soulreaver equipment.\n### Comprehensive Upgrades\n* **Beyond Equipment:**Upgrade not only your equipment but also pets, accessories, and fashion equipment. Each starts at a base tier and can be incrementally improved to higher versions through farming or upgrading.\nThis guide should serve as a foundational reference for your in-game advancement, focusing on both character progression and comprehensive equipment upgrades.\n## Royal Level System Guide\nIf you're new to the game or prefer a standard progression route, there's no immediate need to concern yourself with the Endgame Royal Level System. It becomes relevant once you achieve a very Good Equipment and Platinum Level 50 or higher, at which point you can initiate a Royal Questline in Flarine. Completing this questline advances you from Royal Level 0 to 1.\nTo effectively combat Royal Level monsters, it's essential to acquire Soulreaver weapons and equipment, previously considered endgame items, from the Ethral/Trigrem region. Preparing for this challenge is a significant undertaking and will be detailed in a separate, dedicated guide.",

			"description": "## Shiny Entropia Equipment Dungeons:\nLes Britannia and Abyssal Cove The bosses drop shiny entropia treasure chests, so try your luck obtaining the parts you need (or as mentioned above, buy them from other players). The bonus on these items doesn’t really matter as they won’t transfer to your black equipment upon merging, but the higher the stat the more damage or HP you’ll obtain.\nShiny Entropia Weapons Weapons can be bought for 100 ECP each ([which you’ll earn when levelling to platinum level 50](beginner-guide/what-comes-after-level-175.html#platin-level-rewards)) at Weapon Trader Charly in Flaris.\n### Upgrading your Shiny Gear:\nYou’ll want to upgrade your weapon and equipment to at least +10. You can do this in Flaris at the Upgrade Specialist BoboChan. Choose the safe upgrade option. For your weapon you will need shiny oricalkum (you get these dropped when killing monsters) and scrolls of XProtect (can be bought at Cash Shop Laura in Flaris. For your equipment you’ll need sunstones (dropped when killing monsters) and scrolls of SProtect (buyable at Laura NPC).\nYou’ll also want to pierce your suit (4 times) and weapons (10 times). You can also do this at BoboChan. In order to do this you’ll need moonstones (dropped from killing monsters) and scrolls of GProtect (buyable at Laura NPC). All classes (except for magic classes) will need to put an element on their weapon and suit for maximum damage. You can also do this at BoboChan. For this you will need Elemental Cards and scrolls of GProtect from Laura again. A and 7% cards can be bought at Jewel Manager Peach in Flaris. Better cards can be bought from players or farmed in Rhisis’ Trail. You might already want to put diamonds in your weapon. You can do this at Jewel Exchanger Peach in Flaris. Diamonds can be bought or farmed in numerous dungeons (press V and check the drop log in the teleporter to see which dungeons drop the diamonds). Inserting diamonds never fails.\n**Also Check the Shiny Content Area in our Wiki:** [Shiny](../custom-content/shiny.html)\n## Black Shiny Entropia Equipment Dungeon:\nMagma Cave The boss drops individual set parts, so try your luck!\nBlack Shiny Entropia Weapon Dungeon: Aurania Temple The boss drops black weapon materials and the occasional black shiny weapon box. The black material can be exchanged at Aurania Quest Exchanger Tina for those weapon boxes. The bonuses on these equipment parts and weapons matter, not only for damage and HP purposes but also in endgame for your [soulreaver sacrifice](../systems/soulreaver-sacrifice.html).\n### Merging Shiny to Black:\nFor merging your equipment you’ll need scrolls of armour merge which can be found at Kebaria Exchange Maria. By using the scroll of armour merge (special), you’ll get to keep your awakenings when merging from shiny to black, if you use the normal scrolls, your awakenings will be lost and you’ll have to reawaken your Black Shiny Set. Upgrade levels and cards are kept. For merging your weapons you’ll need scrolls of weapon merge which can be found at the Aurania Quest Exchanger Tina. Upgrade levels and cards are kept. Diamonds will be lost unless you use magic diamonds to remove the diamonds at BoboChan before merging. This isn’t recommended though unless you are using spirit diamonds already.\n**Tutorial for Black Equipment Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-black-shiny-equipment.html)\n**Tutorial for Black Weapons Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-black-weapon.html)\n### Upgrading your Black Shiny Gear:\nIf you haven’t already, you’ll want to upgrade your Black Shiny Equipment and Weapons to +20. From levels 1 to 10 you’ll use shiny oricalkum and scrolls of XProtect for weapons and sunstones and scrolls of SProtect for set pieces. From 10 – 20 you’ll need scrolls of UProtect (Ultra) and ultra sunstones (weapon and equipment). You can get these items at the shiny dungeon exchangers or buy them from players. Don’t forget to insert diamonds in your weapons if you haven’t already!\n**Also Check the Black Shiny Content Area in our Wiki:** [Black](../custom-content/black.html)\n## Soulreaver Equipment:\nDungeon: Trigrem Ruins\nThe boss drops individual set parts.\n## Soulreaver Weapons:\nDungeon: Ethral Garden\nThe boss drops Soulreaver Relics and the occasional soulreaver weapon box.\nThese relics can be exchanged for weapon boxes at the NPC exchanger Raziel in Ethral.\n**Also Check the Soulreaver Content Area in our Wiki:** [Soulreaver](../custom-content/soulreaver.html)\n## Merging Black to Soulreaver:\nFor merging your equipment you’ll need scrolls which can be found at the Trigrem Exchanger Soran.

These items do not require merging of previous items like the Soulreaver. They become available for equipping once a player reaches Royal Level 10, or at Level 6 for those using a Boost Token.\n\nWeapons and equipment can be acquired as drops from the Destruction Cavern or Azmore Forest Dungeon. Additionally, Loot Orbs, which may contain one of these items randomly, can also be obtained. Alternatively, you can purchase them from other players using in-game currency.\nFor players aiming to progress from Royal Level 0 to 10 without utilizing boosts, the Soulreaver is crucial. Monsters cannot be damaged without a Soulreaver Weapon, and without a high-quality Soulreaver Set, your HP may not withstand the Monsters' attacks.\nFurthermore, the previously mentioned Soulreaver equipment and weapons become necessary for crafting special power-ups and a unique character mode (Trance) as you progress further in the game, starting from Royal Level 15. The quality of your Soulreaver set determines the strength of the buffs you receive.\n\n**Other Royal / Cardia Area Information:**\n[What should I do after i reached Royal Level 6?](level-boost-token-royal-level-6/what-should-i-do-after-i-reached-royal-level-6.html)\n[Royal Level 6 / Level Boost Token](level-boost-token-royal-level-6.html)\n[Cardia Patch / Introduction of Royal Levels](https://entropia.fun/index.php?site=news&newsid=701)\n**Other Wiki Informations:** [Royal](../custom-content/royal.html)",

Use Ruby for Strength (STR), Sapphire for Intelligence (INT), Topaz for Stamina (STA), or Emerald for Dexterity (DEX).\n## Aura Jewellery\nDungeons: Mystic Valley (emerald), Underwater World (sapphire), Crystal Cave (topaz), Dark Forest (ruby)\nYou’ll want to upgrade your first set of jewellery (Emerald, Ruby and so on) to their aura variant (e.g. Aura Emerald).

It allows players to skip the grind and instantly access the latest Early Endgame content, the Cardia Beginning.\n## Can i access the Content without the Token?\nYes! The token is only optional for players who want to save time by skipping everything beforehand. Otherwise, it takes several weeks or months, depending on your playtime, to reach this area. Most players have reached it even before the token was available!\nYou decide how you want to play. However, we don't want to deny players the opportunity to play our latest content, which some older players had already experienced years ago and may not want to repeat.\n\nIf you haven't been boosted and have reached Royal Level 6 by yourself, you can also continue with this Guide in this section to see how you should proceed, or you can look in the [Royal](../custom-content/royal.html) section of our wiki.\n## More Detailed Informations\nHere in the wiki, it's briefly outlined, but if you want to know all the details about the boost, please visit our news section [here](https://entropia.fun/index.php?site=news&newsid=942).\n## How Does It Work?\nUpon using the Level Boost Token, you will receive a temporary basic equipment package, enabling you to jump straight into the action. This package includes:\n* Instantly reaching Royal Level 6 and Platinum 50, unlocking job class selection.\n* Access to Cardia and story quests to advance your character to Royal Level 10.\n* Unlocking endgame content dungeons at Royal Level 10.\n* Time-limited Royal Blood & Darkness Set and weapons.\n* Standard DMG & HP Boost Jewelry Set for collecting normal equipment.\n* Random Platinum 50 Pet and power-ups/items for an enjoyable start.\n* Dark Adventurer Set for cosmetic purposes.\n## Important Notes:\n* **Boost packages are designed to complement, not replace, older game content.**\n* Players can still level up without payment, but the boost offers a shortcut.**The Main Reason for that Boost.**\n* Boost Token is one-time use and applicable only for characters under Royal Level 6.\n## Is It Worth It?\nDeciding whether to use the Level Boost Token depends on your playstyle and preferences. Consult with the community or our team to make an informed decision. You can still experience the older content and eventually reach the boosted area without purchasing the level boost token, but it may take some time, as is typical in any MMO. Ultimately, you're here to have fun and manage your time as you see fit! So, just relax and enjoy the game! :)\n## Ready to Boost?\nIf you're level 175 or below, simply purchase the Level Boost Token from the Premium Shop and choose your desired class. Make sure your inventory isn't full to receive all items.\n## Remember\n* Boost items have a time limit of 30 days.\n* Boost Token can only be used once per character and is not applicable beyond Royal Level 6.\n* You'll immediately dive into the Early Endgame, so remember that it's challenging and requires various activities for progression, such as questing to level, do daily quests, dungeon runs, perin farming, and more. The drop rates in the Endgame are customized and slightly higher than official rates, offering an engaging and rewarding experience.\n* Also, keep in mind that you'll also need items from older content. This Level Boost is just to get you started on the initial new content and don't fully skip the older content, so you'll still require some older items to strengthen your character. We elaborate on this on the following page:[**Progression after Reaching Royal Level 10**](level-boost-token-royal-level-6/progression-after-reaching-royal-level-10.html)\n## Get Ready to Conquer Cardia!\nNow that you're equipped with the Level Boost Token knowledge, it's time to embark on your adventure.

Your primary goal should be reaching Royal Level 10. **You can find out how you reach that level a bit below.** Once you've achieved Royal Level 10, prepare yourself for the challenging dungeons of Azmore Forest and Destruction Forest to obtain your first set of Royal Equipment.\n*Initially, it is recommended to run these dungeons as a group or with multiple characters.\nIf you've used the Level Boost Token, remember that your temporary equipment will expire, so it's essential to acquire permanent Royal Equipment by farming it step by step or purchase some from other Players for your Job Class.\n**For more detailed guidance on what to do after reaching Royal Level 10:** Click Here!\n## Is there anything specific I should know after using the Level Boost Token?\nEnsure to perform basic upgrades to your equipment, including awakening your gear with the scrolls found in your inventory, enhancing your equipment by piecing it together and injecting cards and diamonds, adding elements to your weapons, furnishing your equipment, injecting beads into your pets, and awakening fashion items, among other things.\n## How do I reach Royal Level 10? Are there specific monsters to kill for leveling up?\nNo, you won't level up by defeating monsters. Instead, you'll progress from Royal Level 6 to 10 by completing quests in Cardia.

				"description": "**Congratulations on reaching Royal Level 10!**\n\nNow that you've unlocked this significant milestone in Entropia Flyff, it's time to dive into the exciting content that awaits you. Here's a comprehensive guide on what to do next:\n## Focus on Farming Older Content\nFarm older content items to boost your character's values further. Sacrifice Soulreaver Armor with good bonus values to obtain damage and HP power-ups after Reaching Royal Level 15. It therefore makes sense to farm it even incidentally as you progress gradually through the Royal area. Additionally, unlock the Trance Mode, which can be activated periodically through monster kills and filling your trance/limit bar above your character.\n**Importance of Old Content Items in Endgame and for New Players**\nOld content items remain a crucial aspect of gameplay, even in the endgame. These items are necessary for several important activities, such as:\n* **Sacrifices**: Certain endgame processes require old content items as offerings.\n* **Creating Permanent Reroll Effect Stones**: These stones streamline the bonus reroll system for \"Royal +10\" items, significantly aiding in endgame optimization.\nNew players, especially those who choose not to use boosts and progress through the game at a standard pace, also find value in acquiring these items. Whether for crafting, selling, or specific quests, old content items retain their usefulness across all stages of the game, highlighting their enduring value in both early and late game scenarios.\n## Obtain Permanent Ultimate and Omega Items\nAim to acquire permanent Ultimate and Omega Fashion Items. Obtain glyphs, fairies, and power-ups by obtaining Entropia Treasures through various activities such as daily quests, dungeon runs, and server events. Here is a guide on how you can obtain those items without purchasing them from other players: [Ultimate Items](../../sets-weapons-and-items/ultimate-items.html)\n## Acquire Permanent Soulreaver Accessories\nObtain permanent Soulreaver accessories for your class from the Deep Temple Dungeon or other Players and upgrade them to +10 through farming. These accessories can be exchanged for Royal Accessories in the Endgame with Royal Level 15 by gathering the required materials in the Dread Cove Isle Dungeons. Additionally, you will need a replacement for the Boost Accessory, as it is only available for 30 days and you will not receive a new one on that character anymore the Soulreaver Accessorie is the best way to go at that point.\n## Farm Upgrade Materials\nGather upgrade materials to enhance your permanent Royal equipment. Focus on upgrading your permanent gear and weapons, as the boosted 30-day equipment received as a head start has limited duration.\n## Farm Infinity Points\nKill monsters to farm Infinity Points and upgrade your Infinity Grid with additional stats. You can even obtain the required stones for upgrading in the Heaven of Madrigal Dungeon, which provides additional stat boosts.\n## Objective\n**Advance to Royal Level 15** to unlock and experience the lucrative opportunities and enthralling challenges that lie within the Dread Cove Isle Map.\n## Leveling from Royal Level 10 to 15 in the Amethyst Forest\nTo efficiently level up from Royal Level 10 to 15, follow these steps in the **Amethyst Forest** level map, accessible via our teleporter at Royal Level 10.\n### Collect Royal EXP Items\n* **Location:**Initially, begin your search in**Cardia**for Royal EXP items. These items are crucial for augmenting your experience gains.\n* **Other Sources:**Additionally, consider obtaining Royal EXP Scrolls from other players or purchasing them from the Premium Shop. These scrolls significantly boost your leveling process.\n### Key Points to Remember\n* The**EXP Rate**within the Amethyst Forest is notably lower compared to the early game areas. This is due to it being an endgame area, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience. Keep in mind, you do not start in Flaris; this is the endgame content.\n* Persistently farm in the designated area until you reach Royal Level 15.\n* Enhance Your Character with Exclusive Damage, HP and EXP Power-Ups, which are not available in the regular boost packages or are specific to seasonal events or older content. Moreover, take advantage of weekend events to accelerate your level progression efficiently.\n### Accessing Dread Cove Isle Map\nUpon reaching Royal Level 15, you'll gain access to the new **Dread Cove Isle Level Map to Royal Level 20**. This location is esteemed as the premier Penya farming spot within Entropia Flyff. The Dread Cove Isle Map not only introduces new dungeons to explore but also presents an array of challenges to conquer.\n## Adventure Pass Quests\nEvery 3 to 4 months, we offer an Adventure Pass (Battle Pass) in the Premium Shop, which can also be purchased by other players. There, you will receive a custom questline that you can complete with Lord Pang in Flarine.\nFor each quest, you will receive useful rewards for your character, and at the end, always a Fashion Set with very useful effects, which have an exclusive appearance. Additionally, there are extra exclusive models available there.\nRecently, such Adventure Passes have been introduced for midgame and endgame players, each containing different quests.\nYou can find more detailed information about the Adventure Pass on our Wiki: [**Click Here!**](../../systems/adventure-pass.html)\n## World Boss Hunt\nDefeat world boss monsters that spawn at fixed and random times! You will receive useful items needed for the Royal area.\nRecently, starting from Royal Level 6, you will also receive a Hunter's Badge, which you can use with Lord Pang in Cardia to obtain additional rewards for your character.\n## Daily Activities\nComplete the daily quests in Cardia and occasionally those from Kebaria or Aurania as needed. In Cardia, you'll obtain important items, while in Kebaria and Aurania, you'll receive items from older content necessary for crafting certain items such as normal jewelry pieces, specific furniture with status effects, other useful power-ups, and more.\n**With these tips in mind, you're ready to embark on the next phase of your adventure in Entropia Flyff. Enjoy the journey and make the most of your Royal Level 10 progression!**",

This approach is relatively slow but can be effective for those who prefer a steady and methodical progression. By completing quests and gathering specific items, you can steadily increase your alchemy skill over time.\n2. [**Alchemy Battery**](../guides/collectorfield.html)**and Darkon 3 Quest Items (Medium)**: Another option is to utilize the Alchemy Battery to acquire Darkon 3 Quest Items, which can then be used to craft potions. This method provides a moderate pace of leveling, offering a balance between effort and reward. By efficiently utilizing the Alchemy Battery and completing Darkon 3 quests, you can steadily progress your alchemy skill without overwhelming expenses.\n3. **Mass Production of EXP-Potions for Seeds (Fast but Expensive)**: The fastest method involves mass-producing EXP-Potions for Seeds. While this approach allows for rapid leveling of your alchemy skill, it comes at a higher cost. Players opting for this method should be prepared to invest a significant amount of resources into acquiring the necessary ingredients for mass production. Despite its expense, this method offers a swift path to leveling up your alchemy skill for those willing to invest in it.\nChoose the method that best suits your playstyle, considering factors such as time commitment, resource availability, and personal preferences. Whether you prefer a steady pace of progression or are willing to invest in faster results, there's a leveling method tailored to your needs in the world of alchemy.\"\n## How do I get the Alchemy Buff?\nUpon reaching **Alchemy level 25**, players unlock the \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FEOFvZBX9zjQMriIRiuib%252Fbuff_alchemy_max.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da3db607c-0a87-441b-b8f3-342f24dd874c&width=300&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=f3b48602&sv=2\n **Alchemy Buff**, providing a significant advantage in potion crafting and related activities. It's worth noting, however, that Alchemy Level 30 is the highest achievable level in this skill tree.\nWhile aspiring alchemists may aim for the ultimate milestone of Alchemy Level 30, it's important to understand that this final tier doesn't offer additional buffs beyond what is gained at Alchemy Level 25. Essentially, the buffs remain consistent once you attain Alchemy Level 25, even as you progress further to reach the maximum level of 30.\nPlayers should strategize their approach to leveling accordingly, considering whether the additional effort required to reach Alchemy Level 30 aligns with their goals and priorities within the game.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FymU5oKy8JNsSfI7spHIx%252FAlchemyBuff.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D13f3483c-3f39-4084-b2bd-4d30f14bea50&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=e8de861b&sv=2\n## Is there a List of the Recipes?\nClick on this link below to access a comprehensive list of all the recipes available in the game.\n\n[Click here to view the complete list of all recipes and their corresponding requirements!](https://imgur.com/a/2EDccXb)",

This system ensures that your character remains optimized for performance by automatically reactivating your power-ups the moment they expire. Below is a detailed guide on how the system works and how to utilize it effectively.\n## How the Auto Power Up System Works\n1. **Preparation:**Gather the power-ups you wish to automate. These can range from buffs that enhance your character's stats to those that provide specific abilities or advantages during gameplay.\n2. **Activation:**Open the Auto Power Up System interface by following the navigation path:Start > Features > Auto Power Ups.\n3. **Setting Up:**Within the interface, you'll find a designated window where you can manage your power-ups.

Running out of essential power-ups could leave your character at a disadvantage at critical moments.\n* **Balance Your Power-Ups:**While automating, consider the balance of your power-ups. Relying too heavily on one aspect of your character's abilities might leave other areas lacking. A well-rounded approach to power-up automation can provide a more versatile and resilient character.\n## Conclusion\nThe Auto Power Up System is a significant quality-of-life feature that allows players to maintain their competitive edge with minimal effort.

Recognizing the potential for frame issues due to high player traffic, the Black Market has been thoughtfully divided into two distinct sections. This guide provides an overview of accessing and utilizing the Black Market, ensuring a smooth and efficient trading experience.\n## Accessing the Black Market\n1. **Location:**The Black Market is nestled in the northern part of Saint Morning, designed to be easily accessible while exploring the city.\n2. **Teleportation:**For convenience, players can teleport directly to the Black Market by pressing (V). This feature is especially useful for quick access from various locations within the game.\n## Types of Black Markets\nThe Black Market is categorized into two main types, each serving different functions within the game's economy and community:\n1. **Server-side Black Market:**This platform is managed by the game's server, offering a controlled environment where players can purchase or sell items. It's designed to facilitate secure transactions and ensure a stable market economy.\n2. **Player-side Black Market:**Unlike the server-managed counterpart, the Player-side Black Market is entirely run by the players themselves. Here, you can engage in direct trades with other players, offering a more personal and dynamic trading experience. This segment encourages player interaction and provides a space for negotiating deals and trading rare items.\n## Objectives of the Black Market System\n* **Currency Regulation:**One of the primary functions of the Black Market is to regulate the game's currency. By providing a platform for buying and selling items, the system helps remove excess currency from circulation, contributing to economic stability within the game.\n* **Community Engagement:**The Black Market fosters a thriving community market by encouraging players to interact, trade, and negotiate with one another. This interaction enhances the overall gaming experience, making it more immersive and interactive.\n* **Market Diversity:**By dividing the Black Market into server-side and player-side sections, the system caters to a wide range of player preferences and needs. Whether you're looking for secure, server-managed transactions or direct player-to-player dealings, the Black Market accommodates various trading styles.\n## Tips for Using the Black Market\n* **Explore Both Markets:**Take the time to explore both the Server-side and Player-side Black Markets. Each offers unique opportunities and deals, depending on your current needs and trading strategies.\n* **Be Informed:**Before engaging in trades, especially on the Player-side Black Market, research item values and current market trends. Being well-informed can help you make better trading decisions and avoid potential scams.\n* **Use Teleportation Wisely:**Remember that the teleportation feature (V) is a quick way to access the Black Market. Use it to save time, especially when you're far from Saint Morning.\n## Conclusion\nThe Black Market in Saint Morning is a cornerstone of the game's economy and community interaction. By understanding how to access and utilize both the Server-side and Player-side Black Markets, players can enhance their trading experiences, engage with the community, and contribute to the game's vibrant economy. Whether you're a seasoned trader or new to the market scene, the Black Market offers valuable opportunities for everyone.",

This section of the Black Market is designed to offer a controlled, competitive environment for acquiring rare and valuable items. Here's how to navigate and make the most out of the Server-side Black Market.\n## How the Server-side Black Market Works\n1. **Item Listings:**The Server Admin is tasked with listing different items on the Black Market. These items can range from common to rare, each with its unique value and utility within the game.\n2. **Browsing Period:**Once the Black Market session begins, players are given a 5-minute window to browse through the available items. This period is crucial for planning your bidding strategy and deciding which items you wish to pursue.\n3. **Bidding Process:**After the browsing period, the bidding phase commences. Players can start placing their bids on items of interest. The bidding process is competitive, requiring strategic thinking and timely decision-making.\n## Bidding Requirements and Rules\n* **Currency Types:**Items on the Server-side Black Market may require different types of currency for bidding, including ECP, Perin, or even specific items like Black Market Coupons. Black Market Coupons can be acquired from the Vote Shop, adding another layer of strategy to acquiring and using resources effectively.\n* **Minimum Bid Increase:**To place a bid on an item, your offer must be at least 10% higher than the current highest bid. For example, if the current bid on an item is 800 Perin, a new bid must be at least 880 Perin to overtake the highest bidder position.\n* **Winning Bids:**The highest bidder at the end of the bidding timer, displayed alongside the item, wins the item. The won items are directly transferred to the player's inventory.\n* **Outbid Mechanism:**If you are outbid by another player, the currency or items you offered are immediately returned to your inventory. This ensures you can quickly react and place new bids if desired.\n## Handling Full Inventories\n* In cases where your inventory is full at the time of winning an item, the Black Market system ensures you don't lose out on your winnings. Instead, the items are sent to you via the in-game post system, safeguarding your acquisitions until you can make space in your inventory.\n## Tips for Success in the Server-side Black Market\n* **Prepare in Advance:**Ensure you have the necessary currencies and items (like Black Market Coupons) ready before the market opens. This preparation allows you to bid without delays, increasing your chances of winning desired items.\n* **Inventory Management:**Keep your inventory as clear as possible before participating in the bidding process. This precaution prevents any delays in receiving won items, especially in the heat of competitive bidding.\n* **Stay Alert:**The bidding process can be fast-paced. Stay attentive to bid increments and the remaining time on items to adjust your strategy in real-time.\n## Conclusion\nThe Server-side Black Market offers a thrilling and strategic avenue for players to acquire unique items through a competitive bidding system. By understanding the rules, preparing appropriately, and engaging actively in the bidding process, players can enhance their gaming experience with valuable acquisitions, all while engaging in the vibrant economy of the game's community.",

This feature empowers players with the ability to manage their sales, set prices, and engage in the game's economy on a personal level. Here's everything you need to know to effectively use the Player-side Black Market.\n## Listing Items for Sale\n1. **Adding Items:**To list an item for sale, simply drag and drop the item into the designated Black Market window. This intuitive interface makes it easy to manage which items you want to sell.\n2. **Setting the Price:**When listing an item, you'll specify the type of currency you wish to receive (e.g., Perin, ECP, or specific items like Black Market Coupons) and the minimum amount you are willing to accept. This flexibility allows sellers to tailor their sales strategy according to the current market dynamics and their personal goals.\n3. **Activation Fee:**To activate your listing on the Player-side Black Market, a small fee in Perin is required. This fee is a minor investment that enables access to the market's wide audience of potential buyers.\n## Bidding and Sales Process\n* **Bidding Rules:**The bidding process on the Player-side Black Market follows the same rules as the Server-side Black Market. Bidders must offer at least 10% more than the previous bid to participate, ensuring a fair and competitive environment for both buyers and sellers.\n* **Successful Sales:**Once a bid meets or exceeds your minimum set price, and the bidding time expires, the sale is completed. The currency or items bid by the buyer are transferred to you, and the sold item is transferred to the buyer's inventory.\n* **Unsuccessful Listings:**If no bids are received by the time the listing period ends, the item is automatically returned to your inventory. This system ensures that you retain possession of your items in the absence of a successful sale, allowing you to relist the item at a later time or adjust your pricing strategy.\n## Tips for Effective Selling on the Player-side Black Market\n* **Market Research:**Before listing an item, conduct some research on current market prices and demand. This insight can help you set a competitive and realistic starting price for your items.\n* **Clear Inventory Space:**Ensure you have enough space in your inventory before the sale concludes. This preparation prevents any issues with receiving the payment or returning the item if the sale is not successful.\n* **Strategic Pricing:**Consider starting with a slightly lower minimum bid to attract more bidders. A competitive starting price can lead to a bidding war, potentially resulting in a higher final sale price.\n* **Stay Active:**Keep an eye on your listings and the market activity. Being responsive and adjusting your sales strategy based on market trends can increase your success rate on the Player-side Black Market.\n## Conclusion\nThe Player-side Black Market is a dynamic and user-friendly platform that enhances the trading experience by putting the power directly in the hands of the players. By understanding how to effectively list, price, and manage your sales, you can maximize your profits and participate actively in the game's economy. Whether you're a seasoned trader or new to the market, the Player-side Black Market offers valuable opportunities to engage with the community and achieve your trading objectives.",

Here's a breakdown of its components:\n* **Outer Stones:**These stones encircle the grid, each providing 1 to 5 random status values. The cost to insert or remove these stones ranges from 7,500 to 25,000 Infinity Points, depending on the stone's value.\n* **Middle Crystals:**Central to every character's grid from the start, these crystals can be upgraded indefinitely using Infinity Points, allowing for continuous character growth.\n#### Strategy and Progression\nThe Infinity Grid system is designed to reward long-term strategy and progression. By carefully selecting which stones and crystals to upgrade, you can tailor your character's development to suit your playstyle. Whether you're focusing on becoming a formidable fighter, a resilient defender, or a supportive ally, the Infinity Grid holds the key to unlocking your character's full potential.\nEmbrace the journey, strategize your upgrades, and watch as your character becomes a legend through the power of the Infinity Grid.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FRn8Dwhxv9zYUbrPkWCDT%252FInfinity_New_New.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db975dff1-4ade-4048-8330-5c4cf8ef802b&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=f0fc06c6&sv=2\n## Deep Dive into Infinity Stones and Their Acquisition\nThe Infinity Grid system is not just about enhancing your character with points; it's also about the strategic placement and selection of Infinity Stones. These stones, which form the outer rim of the Infinity Grid, are pivotal in customizing your character's abilities to suit your playstyle and objectives. Here's how you can acquire these stones and leverage their potential.\n## Acquiring Infinity Stones\nInfinity Stones are scattered throughout the Kingdom of Madrigal, waiting to be discovered by intrepid adventurers. These stones can primarily be found in:\n* **Kingdom Heaven of Madrigal Dungeon:**This dungeon is a rich source of Infinity Stones, offering a higher chance of obtaining them.\n* **Older Dungeons:**While the focus may be on the Kingdom Heaven, don't overlook the older dungeons. They still hold a chance to drop these coveted stones, albeit at a lower rate.\nTo streamline your hunt for Infinity Stones, consult the Droplist available from the Teleporter. This resource will guide you on where to focus your efforts to maximize your chances of finding the stones.\n## Stone Effects: A Gamble with Great Rewards\nUpon securing an Infinity Stone, its application within the Infinity Grid reveals its true potential. Each stone can bestow upon you 1 to 5 random effects, adding a layer of strategy and anticipation to their use. The beauty of this system lies in its flexibility; if the outcomes don't align with your expectations or needs, you have the option to remove the stones and reapply them, hoping for a more favorable set of effects.\n## Practical Example: The Madrigal Stone (Duplicate)\nTo illustrate, let's consider the placement of a Madrigal Stone (Duplicate) within a slot of the Infinity Grid. The effects you might receive from this action are varied, demonstrating the system's random nature and potential for customization. For instance, you could end up with:\n* 3x STR+1\n* 5x STR+1\n* 2x INT+1, 1x Speed+1%, and DEX+2\nThis variability ensures that each player's experience with the Infinity Grid is unique, offering a personalized approach to character enhancement. The strategic removal and reapplication of stones for different outcomes encourage experimentation and optimization of your character's capabilities.\n## Embracing the Infinity Grid's Potential\nThe journey through Madrigal is fraught with challenges and adversaries, but the Infinity Grid and its stones offer a path to surmounting these obstacles. By understanding where to find Infinity Stones and how to best utilize their effects, you're well-equipped to tailor your character's development to your playing style, ensuring that each adventure is as rewarding as it is exhilarating.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FHoxUwzOnJOUt8xtoRKK9%252FStones.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd673c6a2-7621-463f-a950-85d687519acc&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=7eb2c631&sv=2",

This system is packed with features designed to streamline transactions and improve user interaction:\n* **Shop Bank**: A secure location for all sold and unsold items, complete with notifications.\n* **Character Representation**: An exact replica of your character, including glow, name, guild name, visible equipment, and icons.\n* **Shop Search Function**: Easily find the shops you're looking for.\n* **Multiple Currency Feature**: Supports transactions in various currencies.\n* **Access**: Navigate through Start > Shop > ... to explore these features.\n## Obtaining Vendor Time\nVendor time can be acquired through different activities, depending on whether you're setting up an online or offline vendor:\n* **Online Vendor Time**: Earned through dungeon runs, the Vote Shop, or by defeating[World Bosses](world-boss-system.html)and Killing Monsters.\n* **Offline Vendor Time**: Available as an Item Power-Up via the Vote Shop,[World Boss](world-boss-system.html)encounters, or the Donate Shop or other Players.**If you haven't activated it, you will be limited to an Online Vendor, which is only operational while your character is logged into the game. However, by acquiring the Offline Vendor Buff Item, you gain the ability to set up your shop and go offline, keeping your vendor active without needing to be in the game yourself.*\n* **Note**: Special events may also grant Online/Offline Vendor time as part of their rewards.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FLmeRP9fvWQMqbDh7zlJc%252F300px-Vendor.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D21ce4e29-45d1-476c-bccd-3b1e4ee2a89f&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=309c2434&sv=2\nVendor Shops (Clone of your Character, which offer / sell Items for you!)\n## VIP Shop System\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FGDpHCUSm5M9rICnNo7f7%252F0vu2Zj7_d.webp%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dc4982e3d-cfa0-4fcd-a817-c000fcd30566&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=a831c628&sv=2\nEvery player has the ability to purchase items from the VIP Shop Window. However, your items will only be listed for sale if you have the VIP Shop Status activated through the Item Buff.\nThe VIP Shop System expands upon the standard Vendor Shop System. Without VIP status, offline vendors are not listed in the Shop Search and can only be placed in Saint Morning. The VIP system offers:\n* **Visibility in**[**Shop Search**](../qol-changes/shop-search.html): Your shop will appear in search results.\n* **Flexible Placement**: Set up your shop in almost any location.\n* **Multiple Shops**: Place up to 3 identical shop clones in different locations for increased visibility and reach.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FCp05Or5KH4fdtGAfGWMA%252FpMTYkDA_d.webp%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbbe7743f-197e-4622-99c7-c8128214a087&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=f5000b89&sv=2\nAdditionally, when you have the VIP Shop Status active, you can enhance your Main Vendor by right-clicking on it to add cosmetic shop effects.\n## Why the VIP Shop System?\nSince recent updates, acquiring VIP Shop Status has become more accessible through various methods, including farming. Here's how you can obtain it:\n* **Alchemy Recipes**: Visit the Alchemy NPC located in Flarine, close to the Postbox/Bank-NPC. Here, you can use alchemy recipes that require quest items farmed from across Madrigal.\n* **Alternative Late-Game Methods**: VIP Shop Status can also be obtained through specific late-game activities.\n* **Guild Siege Participation**: Engaging in the Guild Siege events offers another pathway to earning VIP status.\n* **Nitro Boosts and Events**: Monthly distributions from Nitro Boosts, alongside different events, provide additional opportunities to gain VIP Shop Status.\n* **Future Possibilities**: We're exploring more ways to integrate VIP status acquisition into various aspects of the game, so stay tuned for future updates!\n* **Premium Shop:**Additionally, VIP Shop Status can be directly purchased for 1500 Red Diamonds from the in-game Premium Shop!\nThis approach ensures that players have multiple avenues to achieve VIP Shop Status, enhancing their in-game experience and market participation.\n\nThe introduction of the VIP Shop System, requiring a 1500 Red Diamond fee, was a strategic decision aimed at addressing market dynamics rather than profit-making. Its implementation has:\n* **Reduced Market Exploitation**: Diminished the prevalence of free shop-searching for quick Penya, stabilizing market prices.\n* **Encouraged Fair Trading**: Players can now sell items at higher prices, contributing to a more stable economy.\n* **Alternative Earning Methods**: Players can obtain VIP status through in-game activities like Battleground, Rumble, or Penya farming, without mandatory payment.\n* **Maintained Market Activity**: Items in non-VIP shops continue to sell, proving the system's effectiveness in balancing the game's economy.\n### Managing Your Sales and Vendor\n### Locating Your Perins\nSold and unsold items, along with the earned Perins, are deposited in the Shop Bank. Access it via **Start -> Shop -> Shop Bank**. In rare cases, you might need to close your shop to retrieve your items.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fw1AOsDeBtVPG1CrzCTIb%252F300px-ShopbankX.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3De49f92f9-98ac-4f5c-be28-093bb55e2228&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=427d35db&sv=2\n### Closing Your Vendor\nTo close your vendor, simply right-click on the shop. Your items will then move to the Shop Bank, where you can reclaim them into your inventory.\nThis guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of our Vendor System, Shop Bank, and VIP Shop System, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable trading experience for all players.

			"description": "[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FVNeQGknvSZYF4QTpTMzB%252FWardrobeX.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D95333c76-e4d5-4fe6-8934-5f54e2377bf0&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=7dc028a9&sv=2\nThe Modelchange System in the game allows players to alter the appearance of their items or pets, tailoring their in-game experience to their personal aesthetic preferences. This system provides a way to change how an item or pet looks without affecting its stats or functionalities. It's important to note, however, that changes made through this system are permanent unless specific recovery actions are taken. For those looking to make reversible changes or save models for future use, a Wardrobe Token is required, which is detailed in our [Wardrobe System Guide](wardrobe-system.html).\n## Requirements\nTo utilize the Modelchange System, you will need:\n1. **Scroll of Modelchange**: This scroll initiates the model change process.\n## Obtaining the Scroll\n* **Scroll of Modelchange**: This can be acquired at the Entropia Chip NPC for 1000 Entropia Chips.\n## How to Use the Modelchange System\nTo change the appearance of your item or pet, follow these steps:\n1. **Open the Scroll of Modelchange**: This prepares the system for your model change.\n2. **Select the Primary Item**: Identify the weapon, item, or pet whose functionality you wish to retain. Its stats will remain untouched.\n3. **Choose the Sacrificial Item**: Select the model whose appearance you want to apply to your primary item. Note that the sacrificial item will be permanently removed from your inventory after the process.\n4. **Confirmation**: Click the \"OK\" button to finalize your choice and complete the model change.\nOnce these steps are completed, your primary item or pet will adopt the new appearance, and the sacrificial item will no longer be available.\n## Reverting Changes\nTo revert changes made through the Modelchange System, a **Modelchange Recovery Scroll** is necessary. However, it's crucial to understand that this scroll does not restore the sacrificial item used in the model change process. Instead, it reverts the appearance of the primary item to its original state.\n* **Modelchange Recovery Scroll**: Purchaseable at the Entropia Chip NPC for 500 Entropia Chips.\n## Restore Items from a Model Change\nItems that were not modeled in the Wardrobe can be restored to their original form by purchasing the **\"Scroll of Model Recovery\"** from the Vote Shop, which you can find in the Premium Shop, for 2,000 Vote Points and applying it to the item you wish to revert back to its pre-modeled state.\n## Important Considerations\n* **Permanent Changes**: The Modelchange System does not save the original model for later use. To revert to the original appearance, the Modelchange Recovery Scroll is required. However, this scroll will not restore the sacrificial item to your inventory.\n* **Wardrobe Token**: If you wish to save the model permanently for future use, a Wardrobe Token is necessary. This option provides more flexibility by allowing changes to be reversible. For more information on how to use a Wardrobe Token, refer to our[Wardrobe System Guide](wardrobe-system.html).\n* **No Refunds**: Be aware that items used in the Modelchange System, including the sacrificial item and scrolls, are not refundable. Ensure you are certain of your decisions before proceeding with the model change.\n## Conclusion\nThe Modelchange System offers players a unique way to customize their gaming experience by altering the appearance of their gear or pets. While it provides a means to personalize your in-game look, it's essential to plan carefully due to the permanence of these changes. For those seeking more flexibility, the Wardrobe System, accessible with a Wardrobe Token, might be a more suitable option.",

These rewards are crucial for upgrading your equipment and enhancing your overall gameplay experience. This guide provides an overview of how to access World Bosses, the rewards system, spawn times, and additional considerations for specific bosses.\n### Accessing World Bosses\nPlayers can quickly teleport to World Boss locations using the [teleport function (Hotkey: V)](../qol-changes/teleporter.html). This feature ensures that players can join the battle effortlessly, focusing on strategy and combat rather than navigation.\n### Rewards\nEngaging with a World Boss and dealing damage makes you eligible for rewards. These rewards play a significant role in advancing your character's strength and abilities. Participation is key, as it increases your chances of obtaining high-tier loot.\n### Spawn Times and Locations\nWorld Bosses follow specific spawn schedules. Below is a detailed table of their spawn times, including notes on additional random spawns for certain bosses.\nWorld Boss\nFixed Spawn Times\nAdditional Random Spawns\nClockworks\n08:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nEntropia King\n06:30 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nBig Muscle\n08:00 AM - UTC+2\nN/A\nGreat Venux Tree\n03:00 PM - 11:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nProject C-A01\n03:00 PM - 11:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nKrrr\n03:00 AM - UTC+2\nN/A\nMushmoot\n07:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nRoyal Knight\n08:15 PM - UTC+2\n1x Random Spawn between 10AM - 11PM - UTC+2\n#### Special Consideration: Great Venux Tree\nThe Great Venux Tree is located within a PvP (Player vs. Player) Zone. This adds an extra layer of challenge and risk, as other players can attack you during the battle. Moreover, if you are carrying Venux Quest Items in your inventory and are killed by another player, you will lose those items to your assailant. Exercise caution when planning to engage the Great Venux Tree:\n* **Prepare for PvP**: In addition to preparing for the World Boss, ensure you are ready for potential player encounters.\n* **Secure Your Items**: Consider storing Venux Quest Items or other valuable items before heading into the PvP Zone to minimize losses.\n* **Team Up**: Having allies can significantly reduce the risk of being targeted by other players.\n### Strategy Tips\n* **Preparation is Key**: Ensure your gear is in top condition and that you have enough potions and buffs for the fight.\n* **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: Collaborate with other players to effectively manage the boss's health and attacks. Utilizing different roles (tank, DPS, healer) is crucial.\n* **Stay Alert**: Pay attention to the boss's attack patterns and avoid AoE abilities that can be devastating.\n### Conclusion\nThe World Boss System offers a unique and rewarding challenge, providing players with the chance to obtain valuable loot and experience intense combat scenarios. By understanding the spawn times, preparing adequately, and being mindful of the additional risks in certain locations, such as the PvP zone around the Great Venux Tree, players can maximize their chances of success. Teamwork, strategy, and preparation are your best tools in conquering these formidable foes.",

			"description": "Embark on an exciting journey through [Cardia](../custom-content/royal/cardia.html), where hundreds of hidden treasures await the most intrepid explorers! This guide will walk you through the essentials of the Treasure Hunt System, ensuring you know how to find and unearth these valuable caches.\n### Getting Started\nTo begin your treasure hunting adventure, you'll need two key items: a Treasure Map and a Shovel.\n#### Treasure Maps\n* **Finding Maps**: Treasure maps are scattered throughout Cardia, waiting to be discovered by keen-eyed adventurers.\n* **Purchasing Maps**: If luck isn't on your side, visit [Treasurer] Bert to purchase a random treasure map. This can be a quick way to jumpstart your treasure hunting journey.\n#### Shovel\n* **Essential Tool**: A Shovel is indispensable for digging out treasures. Make sure you have one in your inventory before heading out.\n### How to Hunt for Treasure\n1. **Locate the Map**: Begin by acquiring a treasure map. Each map corresponds to a specific hidden treasure within Cardia.\n2. **Open the Map**: Once you have a map, open it to reveal a general location. Navigate to this area to start your hunt.\n3. **Finding the X**: Upon reaching the indicated location, open your map again. This time, you'll see an \"X\" marked on the ground, signaling the exact spot to dig.\n4. **Digging for Treasure**: Use your Shovel to dig at the \"X\" location. If done correctly, you'll unearth a chest containing valuable treasures.\n### Tips for Successful Treasure Hunting\n* **Stay Prepared**: Ensure your inventory has enough space for treasure chests and their contents before you head out.\n* **Be Persistent**: Some treasures may be more challenging to find than others. Don't get discouraged if you don't find them right away.\n* **Explore Thoroughly**: The world of Cardia is vast, and treasures can be hidden in the most unexpected places. Take your time to explore each location thoroughly.\n* **Upgrade Your Tools**: If possible, look for ways to enhance your Shovel.

This system allows players to transform their existing cards into more powerful versions, thereby augmenting their equipment's effectiveness. Below is a detailed guide on how the Card Upgrade System works, including the process of upgrading cards, the resources required, and where to find the necessary NPCs.\n### Overview\nUpgrading cards is a strategic process that involves combining multiple cards of the same type along with specific items called Destruction Prevention Scrolls. This process not only requires a collection of cards but also a financial investment in the form of Perin, the game's currency, and a considerable amount of patience and luck.\n#### Key Components\n* **Cards**: 10 cards of the same type are required for each upgrade attempt.\n* **Destruction Prevention Scrolls**: These scrolls are essential to prevent the cards from being destroyed during the upgrade process.\n* **Perin**: A small amount of this currency is needed for each upgrade attempt.\n### Obtaining Resources\n* [**Destruction Prevention Scrolls**](../custom-content/other/rhisis-trail.html): These can be a challenge to acquire due to their high demand and cost. Players can exchange 750 Entropia Chips for these scrolls at the Card Manager, making it a crucial step in gathering the necessary resources for upgrading.\n* **Entropia Chips**: Typically earned through various in-game activities, these chips serve as a valuable currency for obtaining essential items like the Destruction Prevention Scrolls.\n### How to Upgrade Cards\n1. **Locate a Card Manager**: Visit Saint City or other designated locations to find a Card Manager NPC.\n2. **Prepare Your Cards**: Place 10 cards of the same type into the upgrade window provided by the Card Manager.\n3. **Add a Destruction Prevention Scroll**: Include one of these scrolls to ensure your cards are not destroyed if the upgrade attempt fails.\n4. **Pay the Fee**: Submit the required amount of Perin to proceed with the upgrade attempt.\n#### Upgrade Path\n* **From S-Cards to R-Cards**: Combining 10 S-Cards with the necessary resources can potentially upgrade them to 1 R-Card. This principle applies to upgrading 10% cards to 12% cards.\n* **From R-Cards to Z-Cards**: Similarly, 10 R-Cards can be upgraded to 1 Z-Card, akin to upgrading 12% cards to 15% cards.\n### Tips for Successful Upgrades\n* **Resource Management**: Ensure you have enough Entropia Chips and Perin before attempting upgrades. It's crucial to manage these resources wisely to sustain your upgrade efforts.\n* **Patience is Key**: The upgrade process can be based on chance, so patience and persistence are essential. Not every attempt will be successful, but perseverance can lead to significant improvements in your equipment's power.\n* **Strategic Planning**: Consider which cards to upgrade based on your current equipment and gameplay needs. Prioritizing upgrades that offer the most immediate benefits can enhance your overall performance in the game.",

				"description": "The Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll is a powerful tool in the game that enables players to enhance the bonuses on their equipment or weapons, particularly those that have already been [merged](../../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system.html) or enhanced. This guide will explain how to use the scroll effectively to upgrade your items.\n## Understanding the Scroll\nThe [Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)](../../custom-content/black/kebaria.html) is designed to increase the bonus stats of your items, such as STR on a helmet or any other attribute relevant to your equipment or weapon. It's particularly useful for players looking to maximize the potential of their gear.\n## How It Works\n1. **Identify Your Target Item**: Start with an item that has a bonus you wish to improve, for example, a[Black Slayer Helmet](../../custom-content/black/kebaria/magma-cave.html)with a bonus of 20 STR.\n2. **Find a Compatible Item**: Obtain another Black Slayer Helmet that is either destroyed or[merged](../../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system.html). It's crucial that this item is of the same class and part, and it must have the same stat but a higher value than your current item.\n3. **Prepare to Use the Scroll**: Double-click on the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll to activate it. You will then need to place the item with the higher stat on the left side of the upgrade window and the item with the lower stat on the right side.\n4. **Execute the Upgrade**: Click on the arrow in the middle of the Scroll window. The process will destroy the item with the higher stat, transferring its superior stat to the item with the lower stat.\n## Important Notes\n* **Item Destruction**: Be aware that the item placed on the left side of the upgrade window will be destroyed in the process. Ensure you're willing to sacrifice this item to enhance your target item.\n* **Stat Compatibility**: This scroll allows for flexibility in upgrading stats across different item types, such as upgrading the stats of a 1on1 Knuckle with an HP Knuckle, provided they are compatible in terms of class and part.\nThis scroll allows you to increase your bonus on your already [merged](../../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system.html)item.\n**NOTE: You can upgrade the stats of a 1on1 Knuckle, with HP Knuckle.\nNOTE: The item on the left side will be destroyed.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FWLzV8IUkA9qpfnzU3cNW%252FUpgradeScrollEW.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D8741a169-a1eb-4930-b356-3fe253aae4ed&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=229fd206&sv=2",

			"Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion)": {
				"description": "The Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion) operates under the same principle as its counterpart for equipment and weapons, offering players a method to enhance the bonuses on their fused weapons. This guide will delve into the specifics of using the fusion variant of the scroll, highlighting the differences and steps required to successfully upgrade your weapon fusion.\n## Overview\nWhile the core concept remains the same—upgrading the bonus stats of your items—the application process for the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion) differs slightly to accommodate the nuances of weapon fusion. This scroll is specifically designed to enhance the bonuses on a weapon that has been fused with another.\n## Preparing for Upgrade\n1. **Identify Your Target Fusion**: Start with a weapon fusion that you wish to enhance. For example, if your bow fusion has a main bonus of 20 Critical Damage and the fusion itself has 18 Critical Damage, and you aim to upgrade the fusion to 19 Critical Damage.\n2. **Prepare a New Fusion**: Before using the scroll, you must create a new fusion. Take a bow with 19 Critical Damage and fuse it with a \"crap\" or destroyed black bow. This new fusion will serve as the donor for the upgrade.\n## Using the Scroll\n1. **Activate the Scroll**: Double-click on the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion) to bring up the upgrade interface.\n2. **Arrange the Weapons**: In the upgrade window, place the newly created fusion (with the desired higher bonus) on the left side and the original weapon fusion (with the lower bonus) on the right side.\n3. **Execute the Upgrade**: Click the arrow in the middle of the upgrade window to transfer the higher stat from the left-side item to the right-side item.

Ensure that you are prepared to lose this item as part of the upgrade process.\n* **Strategic Fusion**: The process requires creating a new fusion specifically for the upgrade.

				"description": "The Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scroll for both equipment and weapons introduces a nuanced approach to enhancing your gear within the game. Unlike the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scrolls, these scrolls specifically target the unique bonuses of Soulreaver items, offering players a tailored method to boost their gear's effectiveness. This guide will explain the process of using the Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scrolls, highlighting the key differences and steps involved in upgrading your Soulreaver items.\n## Overview\nSoulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scrolls are designed to enhance the bonuses on Soulreaver items, which are typically more potent and require a specific approach to upgrade. The process involves merging and unmerged items, with a focus on matching the stats for a successful upgrade.\n## Key Differences\n* **Target Items**: These scrolls are exclusively used for Soulreaver items, which must have undergone a merging process to be eligible for an upgrade.\n* **Stat Requirements**: The item used to enhance the merged Soulreaver item must be unmerged and possess equivalent stats to ensure compatibility.\n## Upgrading Process\n1. **Prepare Your Soulreaver Item**: Identify the Soulreaver item (either equipment or weapon) that you wish to upgrade. This item must have already been merged to qualify for the upgrade process.\n2. **Select an Unmerged Item**: Find an unmerged Soulreaver item with the desired higher bonus stats. This item will be used to upgrade the bonuses on your merged Soulreaver item.\n3. **Initiate the Upgrade**: Activate the Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scroll by double-clicking on it. In the upgrade window, place the unmerged item with the higher bonus on the left side and the merged Soulreaver item on the right side.\n4. **Complete the Upgrade**: Proceed with the upgrade by clicking the arrow in the middle of the upgrade window. The unmerged item on the left will be consumed in the process, transferring its higher stats to the merged item on the right.\n## Important Considerations\n* **Item Destruction**: The unmerged Soulreaver item placed on the left side of the upgrade window will be destroyed. Ensure you are willing to sacrifice this item for the sake of enhancing your merged Soulreaver item.\n* **Stat Matching**: It's crucial that the unmerged item used for the upgrade has equivalent or higher stats than the merged item to ensure a successful upgrade.\n* **Upgrade Limitations**: While it is possible to upgrade both the black bonus and the Soulreaver bonus, the process requires an unmerged Soulreaver item with the appropriate stats for each bonus you wish to enhance.\n**Please take note: The item on the left-hand side shall be rendered inoperable during the upgrade process.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FzwYqAPVeF900H0JYIyjb%252FUpgradeScrollEWSR.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da4e9b820-9ef9-46f0-92e5-3e7999645951&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=4e54046&sv=2",

				"description": "The Bonus Transfer Card is a pivotal tool in the game that allows players to strategically enhance their gear by transferring bonuses between items. This guide will delve into the specifics of how to use the Bonus Transfer Card effectively, focusing on its application for black or Soulreaver items.\n## Overview\nThe Bonus Transfer Card offers a unique opportunity to upgrade your equipment by transferring bonuses from one item to another. This process is crucial for optimizing your gear's performance in various game scenarios. However, there are specific conditions and limitations to be aware of before proceeding with the bonus transfer.\n## Key Conditions\n* **Item Type Restriction**: The transfer of bonuses can only occur between items of the same type. For example, a bonus from a weapon cannot be transferred to a suit, and vice versa.\n* **Bonus Variability**: The specific bonus being transferred does not need to match between the two items. This means you can transfer different types of bonuses as long as the items are of the same type.\n## Using the Bonus Transfer Card\n1. **Select Your Items**: Identify the two items you wish to use in the transfer process. Ensure both items are either black or Soulreaver items and of the same type (e.g., two weapons or two suits).\n2. **Prepare for the Transfer**: Place the item with the desired bonus to transfer on the left side of the transfer window. This item will be the source of the bonus. Place the item you wish to upgrade on the right side.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Bonus Transfer Card by double-clicking on it and proceed with the transfer by confirming the action. The item on the left side, which is the source of the bonus, will be destroyed in the process, and its bonus will be transferred to the item on the right side.\n## Important Considerations\n* **Item Destruction**: Be fully aware that the item placed on the left side of the transfer window will be consumed and destroyed during the bonus transfer process. This is a permanent action, and the item cannot be recovered.\n* **Strategic Selection**: Given the irreversible nature of the bonus transfer, it's crucial to carefully select which bonus to transfer and to which item. Consider the overall impact on your gear setup and gameplay strategy.\n**Please keep in mind that the item on the left side will be destroyed in the process.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FqJniDMA9aEO4sDGDfKWN%252FTransferCard2.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7ac98a67-5275-483b-99bd-152f98a0f06f&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=b21041b&sv=2",

This specialized version of the Bonus Transfer Card caters specifically to the nuances of fusion bonuses, making it an essential tool for optimizing equipment. Here's what you need to know to utilize this card effectively.\n## Overview\nWhile the basic Bonus Transfer Card facilitates the transfer of bonuses between two items, the Bonus Transfer Card (Fusion) extends this functionality to include fusion bonuses. This means players can now transfer one (for black items) or two (for Soulreaver items) fusion bonuses from one item to a similar item, enhancing the versatility and strategic depth of gear customization.\n## Key Features\n* **Fusion Bonus Transfer**: Specifically designed to transfer fusion bonuses between two items of the same type.\n* **Compatibility**: Works with both black and Soulreaver items, allowing the transfer of one or two fusion bonuses, respectively.\n* **Type Restriction**: Bonuses can only be transferred between items of the same type (e.g., weapon to weapon, suit to suit).\n## How to Use the Bonus Transfer Card (Fusion)\n1. **Prepare Your Items**: Identify the two items you wish to use. Both should be of the same type and either black or Soulreaver items. The item from which the bonus will be transferred should already have the desired bonus as a fusion.\n2. **Set Up the Fusion**: Before using the card, ensure that the item receiving the bonus has been properly fused. This means placing the item with the desired bonus as a fusion into another item, preparing it for the bonus transfer.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Bonus Transfer Card (Fusion) by double-clicking on it. In the transfer window, place the fused item with the bonus on the left side and the item to receive the bonus on the right side.\n4. **Complete the Transfer**: Confirm the transfer process.

This feature provides a level of flexibility and customization previously unattainable, allowing for strategic enhancements to a player's gear.

The Awake Transfer Card revolutionizes gear customization by allowing these bonuses to be transferred between items, offering players the opportunity to optimize their equipment setup according to their strategic needs.\n## Key Features\n* **Cross-Class Transferability**: Awakes can be transferred between items of any class, such as from one suit to another or between different types of weapons.\n* **Fusion Transfer**: If the original item has a fusion, this fusion (along with its awake) will be transferred to the new item.\n* **Fusion Awake Limitation**: When transferring an awake between items of different types (e.g., from a bow to an axe), be aware that the fusion awake will not carry over and will disappear.\n## How to Use the Awake Transfer Card\n1. **Select Your Items**: Identify the item with the desired awake you wish to transfer and the target item to receive the awake. Remember, the transfer can occur between any types of items.\n2. **Prepare for Transfer**: Ensure that both the source item (the one with the awake you wish to transfer) and the target item (the one to receive the awake) are correctly selected and ready for the process.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Awake Transfer Card by double-clicking on it.

This card offers a solution for when you've exhausted all the reroll attempts on your weapon or equipment, allowing you to restore these attempts and further refine your gear's stats. Here's a detailed look at how the Bonus Slot Recovery Card works and how to use it effectively.\n## Overview\nIn the game, weapons and equipment come with a limited number of rerolls that allow players to optimize the stats of their items. Once these rerolls are used up, the item's current stats become permanent unless a Bonus Slot Recovery Card is used. This card resets the reroll count, giving you additional opportunities to achieve the desired stats on your black or Soulreaver weapons/equipment.\n## Key Features\n* **Reroll Restoration**: Restores the reroll attempts of an item back to its maximum capacity (e.g., 0 out of 5 rerolls to 5 out of 5).\n* **Multiple Uses**: Can be used multiple times on the same item, offering continuous opportunities for stat optimization.\n* **Flexibility**: Provides players with the flexibility to continuously adjust and optimize their equipment's stats as their strategy or needs change.\n## How to Use the Bonus Slot Recovery Card\n1. **Identify the Item**: Select the black or Soulreaver weapon/equipment that has exhausted all its reroll attempts and needs restoration.\n2. **Activate the Card**: Use the Bonus Slot Recovery Card by double-clicking on it in your inventory.

It's especially useful for high-value or endgame equipment where optimal stats are crucial.\n* **Resource Management**: While the card offers the flexibility to reroll stats multiple times, be mindful of your resources. Each reroll is a chance to improve your item, but it also requires careful consideration to ensure you're moving towards your desired stat outcome.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FxAY2dbvypTn1vt1cOW6a%252FRecovery.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9ab448b4-733d-49ab-bc8b-5907c9cde84f&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=e1a76def&sv=2",

Using the category-whitelist can quickly fill up your inventory if not managed properly.\n* **Update Regularly**: As your gameplay needs change, remember to update the Pet Filter settings. What's valuable at one stage of the game may not be as crucial later on.\n* **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to experiment with different settings to find what works best for your gameplay style and current objectives.\n### Tips for Using the Pet Filter\n* **Functionality**: The right side of the Pet Filter operates as a category-whitelist. Here, you can select entire categories of items you want your pet to collect.

Your pet will then collect all items that fall under the chosen categories.\n#### Category-Whitelist (Right Side)\n* **Functionality**: The left side of the Pet Filter acts as a whitelist. Any item you add to this list will be picked up by your pet. This feature is perfect for specifying exact items you're interested in collecting.\n* **Activation**: To enable the whitelist, simply check the checkbox located above the list. Once activated, your pet will only pick up items that are specified in this list.\n#### Whitelist (Left Side)\nThe Pet Filter window is divided into two main sections: the whitelist on the left side and the category-whitelist on the right side. Each section serves a different purpose in helping you manage what items your pet collects.\n### How It Works\nTo open the Pet Filter window, simply press \"U\" on your keyboard. This will bring up the interface where you can customize your pet's item collection preferences.\n### Accessing the Pet Filter\nThe Pet Filter System is a highly customizable feature designed to enhance your gameplay experience by giving you control over what items your pet picks up. This system is especially useful for players who want to focus on collecting specific items, such as lollipops, without cluttering their inventory with unwanted quest items or other materials.

Here's how you can leverage this system to boost your character's PvE capabilities.\n## Creating a Spirit Dice\nTo create a \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FzaCFfRUBR3GgMMx0uRx4%252Fitem_statwuerfel.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D02d63988-7991-48f5-a0c3-322c0d6362db&width=300&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=a31bf389&sv=2\nSpirit Dice, follow these steps:\n1. **Accessing the System**: Navigate toStart -> Features -> Spirit Diceto open the Spirit Dice creation window.\n2. **Placing Items**: Insert one or two items with bonus values into the window. The system will display the chance of successfully creating a Spirit Dice based on the items' bonus values.\n## Chance Calculation\n* **Maximum Bonus Values**: Items with the highest possible bonus values (e.g., STR+50) provide a base chance of 35% for one item and 60% for two items.\n* **Lower Bonus Values**: Items with lower bonus values will have their chance automatically calculated and assigned by the server. For example, an item with STR+25 might have a 15% chance, and two such items would double the chance to 30%.\n**Important**: Once an item is converted into a Spirit Dice, it cannot be restored.\n## Using Spirit Dice\nSpirit Dice are used to grant additional status values to your character, enhancing your PvE performance. Here's what you need to know:\n* **PvE Enhancement**: The additional status values from Spirit Dice are effective only in PvE environments. In PvP areas (with the exception of Venux), these stats do not contribute to your damage.\n* **Status Value Increase**: Each successful use of a Spirit Dice can increase a status value (STR, STA, DEX, INT) by +1, with a 35% chance of success per dice.\n* **Stat Cap**: Initially, status values can be increased up to +75 using standard Spirit Dice.\n## Viewing Stats\n* To view the stats gained from Spirit Dice, press \"H\" to open the Character Info window.\n## Royal Spirit Dice\nFor those looking to push beyond the initial cap, the Royal Spirit Dice system extends the maximum status value increase to +125.\n* **Obtaining Royal Spirit Dice**: These can be acquired through Dungeon Drops, the Exchanger in Cardia, and the Daily Roulette.\n* **Usage Strategy**: It's recommended to use normal Spirit Dice to reach the initial cap of 75 before starting to use Royal Spirit Dice for further enhancements.\n## Conclusion\nThe Spirit Dice System offers a strategic way to utilize armor pieces with less desirable bonus values, turning them into valuable assets for strengthening your character in PvE. By carefully selecting items for conversion and strategically using Spirit Dice, players can significantly enhance their character's performance over time. Remember, this system is designed for long-term progression, providing a rewarding experience as you continue to develop your character's capabilities.",

This command allows you to enchant various stats on your CS Set, with some of the most important enchantments being Str, Sta, Dex, Int, ADOCH, and MP.\nBefore you begin combining your CS Set, it is important to consider which enchantments you will need for your specific class.

These materials can also be obtained from the Vote Shop and **Guild Siege Manager**.\nTo protect your Fashion from failure during upgrading, you can purchase the **Scroll of CProtect**from **[Cash Shop] Laura** in Flaris, rather than having to farm for it.\nAt upgrade levels +4, +6, +8, and +10, you can unlock jewel slots for your Fashion parts. By placing jewels in these slots, you can receive random stat boosts.\nIf you ever want to remove a jewel from your Fashion, you can use the **Scroll of Gem Reversion** to do so.\nIt's worth noting that if you merge an upgraded [Gaia Fashion](gaia-set-extension/gaia-set-exchange.html) with an [Ultimate Fashion](ultimate-items/ultimate-fashion.html), the upgrades will still be present in the final product.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FrP3fN7qGJU3jjifZcF7K%252FFashion_Upgrade_2.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1818e2bf-35a3-419e-a695-d15e3cf15a0c&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=3aaf7c0b&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FAEF04IhW3XvtCEUd9tcZ%252FFashion_Upgrade_3.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7158010d-0dc6-49d9-888c-f56f823e4fba&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=29d78e96&sv=2",

Instead, the key focus is on upgrading them to maximize their potential.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FRHQ0jskM30UxlL32Puna%252Froyaleq.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D689f48c5-7805-4392-b808-166051d9bfac&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=357eab58&sv=2",

				"description": "The new Royal Weapons & Set Parts have the potential to drop with up to three bonus values, two normal ones and one special bonus, which offers higher values. All bonus values in the new system are tailored to each job class. It's worth noting that a Slayer, for instance, cannot get an INT bonus on their helmet.\nIn Cardia, players can re-roll the bonus values of their royal items, but it comes at a cost. To do so, players need different materials from the Endgame dungeons ([Destruction Cavern](../../custom-content/royal/cardia/destruction-cavern.html) and [Azmore Forest](../../custom-content/royal/cardia/azmore-forest.html)) or reroll chests that can be obtained from NPCs with a certain currency. For each item, players have 10 reroll attempts, which can be refilled using a scroll. However, it's only possible to re-roll the special bonus if there is already a special bonus on the item. Players can obtain the special bonus either by dropping it or by using the \"All Lines Roll\" function.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FnLBbi9gViiGaeWEpYCy7%252FAwdssas.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfbfb2b18-e648-458c-bdd7-ec549055258b&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=7f77cc55&sv=2\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FajkfrjgFPqBh2hnwoqxJ%252Fu0BAR7n.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7d9e2b8e-2338-467d-95cd-b6cf5b2c2311&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=fafe13f9&sv=2",

By engaging in these four activities, players can earn Royal Bead Stones, Rainbow Stones, Eternal Stones, and [Cardia Coins](../custom-content/royal/cardia.html).\nUsing these items, players can create Royal Bead capsules at the **[Animal Keeper] Chawi**. These capsules contain different types of beads that offer unique benefits and enhancements to players.\nThe process of obtaining Royal Beads is both challenging and rewarding. Players must work hard and commit to various activities to earn the necessary items to create the capsules. However, the benefits of obtaining and using Royal Beads are significant and can help players gain an edge in battles.\nFurthermore, Royal Beads are available in various types, each with its unique set of benefits. These include attack, defense, vitality, critical, dodge, and more. Each type of bead offers specific enhancements to players, allowing them to customize their gameplay and optimize their performance.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FnM944fqp2nOTAHSSIyOk%252FRoyal%2520Beads.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D420b464d-abc8-468a-9a78-3d7802ea69c6&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=4bf2f5ed&sv=2",

With [party buffs](../../../qol-changes/quality-of-life-changes/partys.html) and a drop bonus, players can collect up to three quest items for each monster defeated, while the boss drops three runes, each worth 100 coins.\nThese runes can also prove useful in the later stages of the game, such as in the acquisition of the [Omega Cloak and Mask Box](../../../sets-weapons-and-items/ultimate-items/omega-cloak-%2b-mask.html).

As previously mentioned, the main currency in the Aminus Dungeon is the rune. These runes are essential for obtaining items that will help you progress in the game, such as fairies or your first jewelry set.

The coins can be used to purchase weapons and other items from the NPC at the entrance of the dungeon. Meanwhile, runes are required for crafting powerful [alchemy items](../../../systems/alchemy.html), which are essential for advancing in the game.\nIt's worth noting that the Catacombs are an excellent source of both coins and runes, making them an excellent spot for players looking to farm these essential resources. With enough time and patience, players can accumulate a large quantity of both coins and runes, which can be used to craft powerful equipment and items later on.\nIn summary, the Catacombs are a crucial dungeon that players must navigate to progress to the mid-game.

So, make sure you're well-equipped and prepared before entering the Catacombs.\n[You can see the map of Catacombs here.](../../../../files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces/b31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu/uploads/BvO5ECUEkyVJePlaHmLK/400px-Catacombs_of_Anguish_Dungeon_Mapf6a8.png?alt=media&token=72c97085-792f-4af1-a208-2f5bd6a5c64d)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FeWYs2OxB18GKRPBmbjOH%252Fcata.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D22898811-4678-4cf0-971e-51aa83b7840d&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=e01d7a09&sv=2",

					"description": "The Wild Dungeons may not hold the highest priority in Entropia, but they are still quite significant. In these dungeons, you will need runes, but they can only be obtained by defeating the end boss. However, you will receive more than three runes at a time, and the number can vary.\nApart from the runes, you can also obtain level 3 beads that will greatly enhance your damage output. Furthermore, you can purchase models and power-ups using the runes from the Wilds Exchanger NPC located outside the dungeon.\nWhile not as critical as some other dungeons, the Wild Dungeons are still worthwhile to explore. The rewards may not be as plentiful, but they can still be quite useful in enhancing your character's abilities. So, be sure to visit the Wild Dungeons when you're ready for a new challenge and to acquire some valuable items to aid you in your journey.\n[You can see the map of Wilds here.](../../../../files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces/b31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu/uploads/4Di912zsx2UmSbq859Z0/400px-The_Savage_Wilds_Dungeon_Map519e.png?alt=media&token=0cd1d9b7-6abe-44da-8374-84b1bed30252)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252F50IasPfB5WsAoSzfnWjH%252FWilds.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da19e42fd-7812-4a67-878f-397970f487f6&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=79bb16e&sv=2",

				"description": "If you are interested in obtaining your own Powerful/Holy/Blessed Key for the necklace slot, which is considered the best in slot option, you will need to venture to Venux and engage in some monster slaying. However, there are some important restrictions to keep in mind.\nFirst and foremost, teleportation is prohibited in the entire Venux area, with the exception of designated safe zones which are marked by small water pools. Additionally, if you are killed by another player while in Venux, you will lose all of the quest items you have farmed there. It's important to note that your quest items are not even safe in your bag, but there is a helpful scroll called V**enus Charm (Drop Protection+)** which can prevent you from losing your items if you happen to die.\nFurthermore, it's important to know that you will not be able to use the Mailbox, Guildbank, or Bank while in the Venux area. All of these factors combined make Venux a very challenging and potentially dangerous place, so it's important to exercise caution and take all necessary precautions before embarking on your quest.\n\n[You can see the map of Venux here.](../../../files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces/b31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu/uploads/4ZEgUXW8b9wMvfT53jn1/Venuxe913.jpg?alt=media&token=3212e8b9-902f-4304-8cae-9230e20e7fcd)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FbbunmKeE66GLfNmM94dI%252FVenux.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dccb610e0-72d8-43f5-89a7-4a579e38c12e&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=685deed0&sv=2",

It is known for dropping a plethora of items, mainly Royal Equipment and upgrade items.\nThe dungeon consists of eight minibosses and a final boss, each requiring up to 5.3 million HP to defeat. Due to the intense level of difficulty, players need a strong tank, preferably one with damage absorb capabilities since the damage dealt is extremely high and must be healed. Hybrid tanks are not recommended, as Suckblood is capped at 7,5%. Unless they are significantly well-equipped, they might not be strong enough to handle the dungeon's challenges.\nIn addition to a sturdy tank, high damage output is also crucial. A minimum requirement for players is to have a perfect SR EQ, but Royal Darkness Equipment is highly recommended for best results. This equipment provides players with the highest damage output and increases their chances of survival in the dungeon.\nOverall, the Destruction Cavern presents a unique and challenging experience for players who are looking for a test of their skills and equipment.

					"What is the Dread Cove Isle?": {
						"description": "In the uncharted waters near Cardia, an island rose from the sea that had not been seen for thousands of years: **Dread Cove Isle**. Shrouded in dense fog, it hid from the world, letting only rumors of its existence seep through to the neighboring ports.\nPirates, attracted by the lure of immense wealth, were drawn to these rumors. Ships filled with rough and rugged seamen set off to discover the island and plunder its treasures. All returned with tales of strange occurrences and mysterious phenomena.\nThe island itself was a bizarre landscape, dominated by a dense, impenetrable jungle called Umbala and crisscrossed by expansive caves overrun by pirates. The trees in the Umbala jungle seemed to whisper and move as if they were alive, emanating an aura of magic and mystery that kept all intruders at bay.\nThe cave, deep beneath the surface of Dread Cove Isle, was a labyrinth of dark passages and rooms. Pirates discovered ancient, saltwater-etched writings on the walls and found chests full of gold and jewels. But with each treasure they lifted from the depths of the cave, they seemed to awaken an even deeper darkness.\nIt was as if the island was resisting its plunderers. The fog grew denser and eerier. The trees in the Umbala jungle seemed even more threatening and the whispering grew louder. Eventually, entire pirate ships disappeared after leaving the island, never reaching their home ports.\nDespite these warnings and mysterious incidents, the wealth hidden on Dread Cove Isle could not deter the pirates. They kept returning, drawn by the prospect of treasures and the mystery surrounding the island.\nThus, Dread Cove Isle remains an island of mystery and danger to this day, its treasures and terrors sought alike by greedy pirates. It is a world full of mysteries and wonders, hidden in a fog of oblivion and legends. Those who dare to uncover its secrets must be prepared to face the consequences that come with the treasures of Dread Cove Isle.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FgLaNanIvEb0V9NYy5wOD%252Fs2WaAwC%2520-%2520Imgur.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1416b9a3-31d6-4140-8c8f-2d4a99c8e223&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=cb71aec9&sv=2",

			"🪓 Slayer": {
				"description": "The Slayer is widely considered to be the class with the highest 1v1 damage output in most MMORPGs. This is because the Slayer's kit is designed to excel in single target combat. Unlike other classes that may have more versatile kits or better AoE damage, the Slayer is focused solely on dealing as much damage as possible to a single target.\nHowever, this focus on 1v1 damage comes at a cost. The Slayer has very little AoE damage potential, which makes it difficult for them to take on groups of enemies or clear out large areas quickly. Additionally, the Slayer has low, making them more vulnerable to attacks.\nFurthermore, the Slayer lacks a support kit, which means they are not able to heal or buff allies like other classes such as Priests or Paladins. And while the Slayer can still contribute to group play with their high single target damage, their lack of support abilities can make them less desirable for group content.\nAnother weakness of the Slayer is their farming potential, which is quite low compared to other classes. This is due to the Slayer's focus on single target damage, which makes it difficult for them to farm large groups of enemies efficiently.\nDespite these weaknesses, the Slayer's high 1v1 damage output makes them a formidable opponent in PvP and boss fights. However, their hybrid build can tax their damage output, pushing them down to a lower tier of DPS compared to other classes. As a result, Slayers are often placed in the front line of battles, relying on their high damage output to take down enemies quickly before they have a chance to strike back.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fmr5WPX8Xoex0PlilNO9v%252FSlayer.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D07153d56-89c4-4ba7-b62b-82bcca06ac5d&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=a9122d46&sv=2",

			"🃏 Harlequin": {
				"description": "The Harlequin is known to have the second highest 1v1 damage output. Similar to the Slayer, the Harlequin lacks good AoE damage and a support kit, but they do not have as low HP as the Slayer. This makes them a decent option for soloing low-tier dungeons, as they have enough HP to withstand enemy attacks while dealing high damage output.\nHowever, just like the Slayer, the Harlequin has little farming potential due to their focus on single target damage. They are not as efficient at clearing out large groups of enemies quickly, which can make it difficult to farm resources and complete quests.\nBecause of their slightly higher HP compared to the Slayer, the Harlequin is able to maintain good survivability while dealing a high amount of damage in 1v1 combat. However, their damage output is slightly lower than that of the Slayer, which is a tradeoff for their improved survivability.\nOverall, the Harlequin is a strong option for players who enjoy dealing high amounts of single target damage and have a preference for solo content. Their ability to survive in combat, combined with their high damage output, makes them a good choice for taking on bosses and other powerful enemies. However, in group content where support and AoE damage are important, the Harlequin may not be the best fit.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252F8YZFgzVjPv2bfOcYrUZw%252Fharlequin.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5031eff0-9fca-49cf-a04f-7fb501d7fcb7&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=becde1d7&sv=2",

The Mentalist has a decent AoE damage output and a fine 1v1 damage, but not much more beyond that. They have a low base HP and lack a support kit or other skills that can assist the group.\nWhile the Mentalist may have a disadvantage in 1v1 combat against classes like the Slayer and Harlequin, they make up for it with their ability to apply debuffs to bosses. This can be a significant advantage in group content, where debuffing the boss can help the group deal more damage and increase their chances of success.\nHowever, due to their focus on AoE damage, the Mentalist has lower damage output compared to the Slayer and Harlequin. They are not as efficient at dealing high amounts of single target damage, which can make it difficult to take on powerful enemies in 1v1 combat.\nOverall, the Mentalist is a great option for players who enjoy dealing AoE damage and providing debuffs in group content. They may not be the best fit for players who prefer solo content or who want to deal high amounts of single target damage. However, in group content where support and debuffs are important, the Mentalist can be a valuable asset to the team.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FlIIsFwRiwPTfkVa0a993%252FMentalist.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D389050f6-c762-4c09-aca0-d26e9b03213e&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=eb8cdfa6&sv=2",

			"🥊 Force Master": {
				"description": "The Force Master has been recognized for possessing the fourth highest 1v1 Damage among all the classes. However, one might ask, why is this the case? To begin with, the Force Master is regarded as the second best Tank Class due to his impressive base HP, which sets him apart from his peers. Additionally, his AoE capabilities are relatively decent, and his 1v1 Damage output is not too shabby either.\nDespite his prowess in multiple areas, the Force Master's overall gameplay style is that of a Hybrid. Consequently, it is expected that his 1v1 Damage output should not be excessively high. This is where his unique debuff comes into play, which helps to mitigate any minimal lack of damage that may be encountered during combat. Overall, the Force Master is a versatile class that boasts an array of impressive abilities and attributes, making him a formidable opponent in both group and individual fights.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FoQEWQx2QQwwrhAqRxBAY%252FForce%2520Master.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D610af929-29bf-4b94-ab94-057793ec41f7&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=3b90c6c9&sv=2",

			"🏹 Crackshooter": {
				"description": "The Crackshooter is a class that typically has the fifth highest 1v1 damage. However, the Crackshooter's strengths extend beyond just damage output.\nOne of the key advantages of the Crackshooter is their Entropia Movement skill, which allows them to cut through attacks or shoot through walls. This ability makes them very effective at farming and exploring, allowing them to reach areas that other classes might not be able to access.\nIn addition to their movement abilities, the Crackshooter also has a decent base block chance and respectable AoE damage output. These abilities make them effective in combat as well, allowing them to take on groups of enemies and deal damage while avoiding attacks.\nBecause of their strong farming potential and versatility in combat, the Crackshooter's 1v1 damage output is slightly lower than other classes like the Slayer and Harlequin. This is a deliberate balancing decision, as the Crackshooter's other strengths make them a valuable asset in a variety of situations.\nOverall, the Crackshooter is a class that offers a unique mix of movement, farming, and combat abilities. While their 1v1 damage output may not be as high as other classes, their versatility and flexibility make them a valuable addition to any group.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FcfbCrCPSv1LjwXAIEZUV%252FCrackshooter.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da8361bb9-14a9-4ed0-bebe-013113ad40ca&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=7e2d67f9&sv=2",

			"Arcanist": {
				"description": "The Arcanist is known for his exceptional ability to deal massive amounts of damage to multiple targets at once, thanks to his powerful AoE spells. His primary strength lies in his ability to obliterate large groups of enemies with ease, making him a sought-after asset in group settings. However, when it comes to 1v1 combat, the Arcanist's damage output is not as impressive as some of the other classes, which might lead some players to overlook him in favor of other options.\nDespite this, we believe that ranking the Arcanist too low on the list would be a disservice to his unique strengths. His unparalleled AoE damage output more than justifies his position on the list, even if his 1v1 damage is not as high as some of the other classes. To balance out this discrepancy, we decided to upgrade his Bubble Damage, making him more effective in both PvE and PvP combat.\nBy upgrading the Arcanist's Bubble Damage, we hope to make him a more viable option for players who prefer a more well-rounded character. This upgrade will enable him to deal more damage to single targets, while still retaining his impressive AoE capabilities. In summary, while the Arcanist's 1v1 damage may not be as strong as some of the other classes, his exceptional AoE damage and well-rounded kit make him a valuable asset in any group setting.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FvXV8Nxpe3A1rgn3vVDqg%252FArcanist.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Ddc77daa2-6cd9-41fe-bc91-ba57c9c1a5ab&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=bab5a48&sv=2",

				"description": "The Templar is a class in Entropia that is primarily designed for tanking and supporting roles. As such, his kit is not primarily focused on dealing high damage output, which is why he is ranked seventh in terms of 1v1 damage. While the Templar does have decent 1v1 damage, it is not as strong as some of the other classes higher on the list.\nMoreover, the Templar's AoE damage is lacking when compared to some of the other classes. However, the Templar's main strength lies in his tanking abilities and his ability to sustain himself in combat. His high base HP, strong armor, and various self-healing abilities make him a formidable tank and a valuable asset to any team, especially in dungeons where survivability is crucial.\nIn summary, while the Templar may not have the highest damage output, his well-rounded kit and strong tanking abilities justify his placement as the 7th class in terms of 1v1 damage. He may not be the most flashy or damaging class, but his ability to take hits and keep himself and his team alive make him a valuable addition to any group.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FRw0kOWIuammcWqkcUfXW%252Ftemplar.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D4ce5dc22-f644-4741-80b6-644d4b352382&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=76cd00d&sv=2",

While it is not a full supporter like some other classes, it has a support kit and is playable as 1v1.\nOne of the standout features of the Seraph is its very good AoE damage, which makes it a valuable asset in party situations where large groups of enemies need to be taken down quickly. Additionally, the Seraph has a decent HP EQ, which allows it to hold its own in combat.\nBut what really sets the Seraph apart is its versatility. It can perform well in a variety of roles, from dealing damage in 1v1 situations to providing support to the rest of the party. This makes it a valuable addition to any group, and a strong choice for players who want to be able to handle any situation that comes their way.\nWhile the Seraph's 1v1 damage is not as high as some of the other classes on this list, its versatility and ability to adapt to different situations more than make up for it.

		"🛡 Self Sustain Tank": {
			"description": "A Self Sustain Tank is a class that is capable of absorbing large amounts of damage while also healing themselves due to their high survivability. To build such a tank, it is important to focus on the right equipment, abilities, and attributes.\nFirstly, the tank needs to have high endurance to withstand as much damage as possible. Therefore, all attributes that increase endurance should be maximized. It is also important for the tank to have enough strength to occasionally deal damage and draw the opponent's attention. Thus, the character's strength should also be increased.\nIn terms of equipment, it is crucial for the tank to have high defense to absorb damage. A good armor and shield are essential for this. It is also important for the tank to have a weapon that supports their self-healing abilities. A weapon with life-regeneration stats or one that enables healing is a good choice.\nFinally, optimizing the tank's abilities is essential to increase their survivability. Abilities that reduce damage or heal are particularly important here. Some abilities that improve the tank's health can also be useful. It is also important to prepare the tank for the use of potions and buffs to quickly respond to difficult battles.\nIn summary, building a Self Sustain Tank requires a strong combination of endurance, defense, strength, self-healing, and tactical gameplay. With the right equipment, abilities, and strategy, a Self Sustain Tank can be a valuable addition to any group.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FokB3Kmgmdm95BOflKkJX%252FSelfsustaintank.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D682528e6-10c2-46a0-ac30-d118182d80c9&width=400&dpr=1&quality=100&sign=fcbe613e&sv=2",
