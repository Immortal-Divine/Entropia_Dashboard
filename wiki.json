Must be at start of line. |\n| **LIST** | `* Item` | Use an asterisk. Must be at start of line. |\n| **QUOTE** | `\u003e Text` | Use a greater-than sign. Must be at start of line. |\n| **DIVIDER** | `___` | Three underscores create a line. |\n| **LINK (Web)** | `[Name](https://url.com)` | Standard web link. |\n| **LINK (Wiki)** | `[[PageName]]` | Links to another Wiki Node. |\n| **LINK (Named)**| `[Link to Home](wiki:Home) ` | Links to a Node with custom text. |\n| **IMG (Full)** | `[img] URL` | Full size image. |\n| **IMG (Icon)** | `[imgi] URL` | **Icon Size:** Resizes to 32px width. |\n| **IMG (Small)** | `[imgs] URL` | **Small:** Resizes to 25% width. |\n| **IMG (Med)** | `[imgm] URL` | **Medium:** Resizes to 50% width. |\n___\n\n## How to Create Tables\nTo create a table, wrap your text in pipes `|`.\n1. The **First Row** is always the Header (Dark background, Red text).\n2. The **Second Row** is the separator (e.g., `|---|`). The wiki hides this row automatically.\n3. **Subsequent Rows** are your data.\n\n`| Item | Cost |`\n`|---|---|`\n`| Sword | 100 |`\n\n___\n\n## Important Notes \u0026 Hints\n\n**Headers \u0026 Lists inside Tables:**\n* You cannot use Headers (`#`) or Lists (`*`) **inside** a table cell. The script only detects these if they are at the very start of a new line. Inside a table, the line starts with `|`, so they will be ignored.\n**Workaround:* Use `**Bold**` inside tables instead of Headers.\n\n**Code Blocks \u0026 Escaping:**\n***Note:** Markdown formatting is **disabled** inside code blocks.\n***Protected Text:** `**Bold**` will appear exactly as `**Bold**`, not bold.\n***Protected Links:** `[[Link]]` will appear as text, not a clickable link.\n\n**Internal Wiki Linking:**\n* To link between pages within this dashboard, use the exact **Name** of the node.\n***Quick Link:** Wrap the node name in double brackets: `[[Home]]`\n***Custom Text Link:** Use the `wiki:` prefix: `[Click Here](wiki:Home)`\n\n**Image Formats:**\n* The script supports direct URLs (e.g., `https://i.imgur.com/example.png`).\n* `[imgi]` is perfect for item icons inside tables.\n* `[imgs]` is good for side-by-side screenshots.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n***Table Formatting:** If your table looks broken, ensure the second row contains only dashes and pipes (e.g., `|---|---|`).\n***Images Not Loading:** Ensure the URL is a direct link to the image file (ending in `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.), not a link to a gallery page.\n***Raw HTML:** HTML tags (like `\u003cb\u003e`) are disabled for security; use the Markdown syntax instead.",

                    "description":  "[img]https://i.imgur.com/XJFagcS.png\n\n# Introduction \u0026 Goals of Genesis\n\u003e Why does the event server exist in the first place?\n\nEven so, we know that over the last year, for private reasons, we haven’t met every goal in terms of content pace – especially when it comes to onboarding new players. The in-game economy is solid, but not as strong as it could be, and some systems have grown historically rather than being deliberately planned.\n\nThis is exactly where our new, one-time event server comes in:\n\n### “But you already have quite a lot of players?” – Why we’re launching Genesis anyway\nAt this point we want to make one crucial thing clear:\n***Genesis is not a short-lived “speed server”** that disappears again after a few months – unlike many other new, short-lived projects with other goals that may entice with nice visuals here and there or flashy systems, but whose core isn’t really well thought out.\n***Entropia is a long-term project** – stable for years, continuously developed, and carried by a strong, loyal community that has grown over many years and forms the heart of our project.\n***Genesis is not a replacement, not a full wipe, and not a throwaway server**, but a time-limited, fully integrated expansion chapter whose progress seamlessly transitions into the main server and continues there permanently.\n\n___\n# What Genesis Is Meant to Achieve\n\u003e Fresh start, feedback \u0026 long-term update\n\n### Fresh start for everyone\nGenesis is a time-limited event server (runtime: approx. 5 months) through which we’re pursuing several goals:\n* After almost 5 years without a wipe, we want to offer a one-time, clearly framed fresh start – for new, returning, and active players alike.\n* Everyone starts at the same time, without old advantages and without pay-to-win baggage.\n\n### A complete journey through Entropia – in a modern, streamlined form\n* The event server presents Entropia in **“milestones”**.\n* Adjusted stats, drop chances, EXP, RXP, GXP, Alchemy EXP, balancing and several new quality-of-life changes.\n***Every 1–2 weeks** new content will be unlocked.\n* You experience progression step by step, together with others.\n* We can observe where it feels good – and where it doesn’t.\n\n### Targeted feedback for a major live-server update\nWhile Genesis is running, we are simultaneously working on a particularly large and content-rich update for the main server that goes far beyond our usual patches.\n* Your feedback from Genesis (EXP, drops, early game, progression, PvE/PvP balance, economy) flows directly into it – for example, which changes from the Genesis server should be carried over to the live server after the merge, or what exactly about the concept should be adjusted.\n* Suggestions are discussed within the team and with beta testers and then implemented into the large update for the main server.\n\n### Server merge instead of throwing things away\n* After roughly five months, Genesis will be merged with the main server.\n* Your characters, items (with a few exceptions), and invested time will remain.\n* At the same time, the big content update, based on your Genesis experience, will be rolled out.\n* It’s not a “new permanent server” but a one-time journey whose result transitions into the existing server.\n\nWe’re also using Genesis to realign how we work:\n* Instead of “too many construction sites at once”, we’re focusing on clearer, long-term plans.\n* More focus on new players, progression flow, and a stable, healthy economy.\n* Thanks to Genesis, we can evaluate data and feedback (drop rates, EXP, market prices, balance) much more effectively and react more precisely.\n\nIn parallel, we’re developing a major update, parts of which we will showcase on Genesis as a preview before the merge – but deliberately not everything. The upcoming update should feel like its own, surprising experience, just like the big Cardia release did back then.\n\n___\n# General Gameplay \u0026 Comfort\n\u003e What to expect on Genesis\n\nGenesis is meant to feel more accessible and rewarding, but not like a “stressful grind”. Some core changes:\n\n### General convenience features\n* All players have **free access to VIP shop features** and receive more EXP, RXP, Alchemy EXP as well as increased drops and drop chances.\n* Many **Anarchy buffs** can be activated directly by players through the Anarchy buff window – including *Infinity Power*, *Dove of Luck*, as well as the new **Drop +1 Anarchy buff**, which a single player can trigger for the entire community.\n* Easier access to **Entropia Treasures** (farm / shop):\n  * Released gradually over time.\n  * Additionally integrated as **rare drops in dungeons**.\n\n### Shop system \u0026 dungeon entries\n* The shop search still shows all player shops but no longer has instant-buy.\n* Via right-click you can display the position of shops on the map.\n* With premium status you can **teleport directly to a shop up to 5 times per day**.\n* Dungeon entries have been reworked:\n  * No more mass “dungeon checklist” that feels like work.\n  * Focus on meaningful but relaxed gameplay instead of compulsion.\n\n### Guilds \u0026 progression\n***Guild EXP rate: x5** increased.\n***Guild slots limited to 30 members** so that more guilds can quickly reach a usable level and participate in endgame systems after the merge.\n  * *➜ The slot limit will be raised again after the merge.*\n***Infinity points per kill** have been increased to make leveling feel more pleasant and less sluggish.\n\nFor certain balance adjustments or milestone releases, we will actively seek feedback and consult with the community – for example, how we should design specific content or adjust certain rates. We’ll use targeted surveys for this.\n\nMost “historic easings” from recent years remain in place. A few specific features – such as **Black Shiny weapons at the Entropia Chip NPC** – have been deliberately removed in order to keep progression exciting.\n\nDungeon drops and some monster/boss values have been adjusted so that runs feel worthwhile and the risk is rewarded appropriately.\n\n___\n# Milestones \u0026 Duration\n\u003e Content unlocking step by step\n\nGame content will be unlocked in **milestones**. Every 1–2 weeks, new content is added, which then remains active until the merge.\n* During this time we’ll make balance changes (PvE, PvP, EXP, drops, Penya, exchangers, NPC costs) if something is too hard, too trivial, or unhealthy for the economy.\n* The event server will otherwise remain relatively stable – larger system changes are deliberately prepared for the later content update on the main server.\n* There will be no brand-new systems or big new content exclusive to the event server: the focus is on feedback, balance, and a fresh gameplay experience.\n* We will fix bugs, exploits, or unfair situations as quickly as possible – Genesis is not a “test server with wild west rules” but a fully fledged server with clear responsibility on our side.\n\n\u003e **Maintenance:** Adjustments and maintenance will generally take place **every Friday**. Depending on the scope, these may be performed between early morning and evening and usually take around **20 to 40 minutes (+/–), assuming nothing unexpected happens**.\n\n### Brief overview of the milestones\n\n| **Milestone** | **Date** | **Unlocked content** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Milestone 1** | December 5, 2025 | • Entropia content up to Platinum 30 • Kebaria • Aurania • Black Shiny content |\n| **Milestone 2** | December 19, 2025 | • Entropia content up to Platinum 50 • Trigrem / Ethral • Associated dungeons \u0026 Aurania jewelry dungeons • Soulreaver content |\n| **Milestone 3** | January 2, 2026 | • Royal Cardia content up to Royal level 20 • Dread Cove Island • Royal content |\n| **Milestone 4** | January 23, 2026 | • Pirate Cave • Umbala • Astral Forest Dungeon |\n| **Milestone 5** | February 13, 2026 | • Kogarashi Pass • Celestara |\n\n*Some content from earlier milestones will be simplified over time if community feedback suggests that it makes sense. The respective areas are marked as **“Milestone”** in the teleport window.*\n\n___\n# Economy, Treasures \u0026 Currencies\n\u003e How Genesis affects the economy\n\n### Entropia Treasures\n**Ultimate Entropia Treasures** will be introduced on Genesis step by step – at reduced prices.\n* Many will remain as level rewards.\n* Some chests will only be integrated into level rewards (P51+ rewards) once they have appeared as event or discounted shop items on Genesis.\n* Certain chests will be **rarely farmable** (e.g. not just at the very end like Kogarashi) so that their value remains stable after the merge.\n* Additionally, treasures will be available from the **Platinum Exchanger for Perin** – we will adjust prices dynamically.\n\n*Example: A standard Entropia Treasure may start at 200 Perin, rise to 300 Perin after two weeks, and the next treasure may go to 400 Perin, etc. – depending on the market situation.*\n\n### Currency reset on merge\nTo keep the economy stable and healthy after the merge, only the major farmable currencies will be removed from Genesis when the server merges:\n\n| **Currencies** | **Status after the merge** |\n|---|---|\n| Perin, Black Perin, Entropia Chips, Entropia Chip Perin | **Will be reset** (removed) to prevent a huge flood of currency. |\n| All other items (gear, fashion, materials, etc.) | **Remain fully intact** – including equipment, upgrades, fashion, collections, materials, and more. |\n\nThis very clearly means:\n**It’s worth actively investing your currency on Genesis into your characters and equipment**, instead of simply hoarding Perin \u0026 co. Your progression (gear, enhancements, builds) remains fully intact, while we prevent a pure money flood from destroying the in-game economy.\n\n___\n# Vote System \u0026 Diamonds\n\u003e Vote items, Blue Diamonds \u0026 conversion\n\n### Vote system \u0026 vote items\nThe vote system has a major impact on the economy and prices. To minimize multi-voting abuse:\n* All **vote items are bound on Genesis** and cannot be traded.\n  * *➜ No flood of CW runes, King’s Hearts \u0026 co through account sharing or masses of own alt accounts.*\n* You can only start collecting vote points once the new homepage is live.\n* There you can choose whether you vote for the main server or the event server (via the homepage or as usual via NPC/in-game – with two separate options).\n\n### Red Diamonds \u0026 Blue Diamonds\n* There are **no Red Diamonds** on the event server.\n* Genesis uses only **Blue Diamonds**, which are completely separate from the Red Diamonds of the main server.\n  * *➜ No one can buy an advantage on Genesis through main-server donations.*\n* After the server merge, **Blue Diamonds from Genesis will be converted into Red Diamonds**, so your currency will not be lost and can be used meaningfully on the main server.\n\n___\n# Character Names \u0026 Adventure Passes\n\u003e What happens on merge \u0026 which passes return\n\n### Character names after the event server\n* Characters with **unique names** that do not exist on the main server will be transferred without any name change.\n* If a character name already exists on the main server:\n  * the character from the Genesis event server will either receive a **randomly generated name** or\n  * the same name with an **appended number**.\n  * Additionally, a **Scroll of Forgotten Names (rename scroll)** will be provided.\n\n### Adventure Passes (Battle Passes)\n* All Adventure Passes will be playable again over time (**Pass 1 through Pass 8**).\n* You can **earn the fashion sets and rewards one more time**.\n* Each pass runs for around **1–2 weeks** and offers manageable challenges with high-quality rewards.\n* We’ll keep an eye on effects \u0026 rarity so that old exclusivity is not completely devalued.\n\n___\n# Loyalty Rewards \u0026 Special Bonuses\n\u003e A thank you to loyal players\n\n### Loyalty Treasure for long-term players\nAll players who, between **September 20, 2025** and the day of this announcement (**November 23, 2025**):\n* have reached Platinum level 60+ or Royal level 6+ and\n* have at least 50+ hours of play time,\n\nwill receive a **Loyal Entropia Treasure** containing, among other things:\n\n| **Category** | **Contents of the Loyal Entropia Treasure** |\n|---|---|\n| Fashion | 6 fashion sets in M/F (including the Bhalri Set, Lixopus Set, Loyalty Set) |\n| Badges \u0026 Titles | Various badges (including new, exclusive ones for the Genesis start) + Scroll of Title for a custom title |\n| Premium \u0026 Buffs | Premium (7 days), 2× Drop +1 (1 hour each), 2× Anarchy Buff Lucky Box |\n| Treasure contents | 5× Entropia Treasures |\n\n*This chest is a thank you to loyal players without creating an overwhelming advantage. You can claim it at the start of Genesis via the updated homepage for one character on the new cluster.*\n\n___\n# PvP \u0026 PvE – A New Approach\n\u003e Transparent balance \u0026 less chaos\n\nFor PvP, we are trying a new approach to give everyone the cleanest and most understandable PvP experience possible:\n* On the event server, **all special PvP effects have been removed**.\n* Diamonds have been adjusted: **stat diamonds match PvE diamonds in terms of damage**.\n* Some power-ups have been completely removed or slightly reworked to avoid extreme outliers.\n* You will only need **one PvE damage equipment set** and one **HP/tank equipment set** – no more confusing split into separate PvP gear sets.\n\nThe **Battleground mode**, where every player is given a predefined class with fixed equipment, will only be unlocked later during the event server. Until then, the normal PvP mode remains active as usual.\n\nWe will continuously work on PvP and PvE balance on the event server:\n***Weekly adjustments** if certain classes, builds, or setups are too strong or too weak.\n* Some changes will even be tested live via **world buffs**, allowing us to react quickly and incorporate your feedback directly.\n\n___\n# Custom Fashion, Recolors \u0026 Top Donator Rewards\n\u003e Exclusive looks – implemented fairly\n\n### Custom fashion / recolors \u0026 badges\n* All players who have already received a **custom fashion, pet, weapon/recolor or custom badge** via Black Market, top-donator titles or events will receive an additional copy on the Genesis event server.\n* Players who bought a fashion set from someone else on the main server will receive that set again, because it was created for them. The players who sold the set will not receive an additional or new copy.\n* Please create a ticket with your character name and ideally a screenshot proving you own these items on the main server by **December 10, 2025**.\n* These items will be transferred back to the main server during the later merge, so you can **use them twice for alternate characters**.\n\n### Top donator rewards\n* The top donators of the months **August, September, October and November 2025** will receive a **custom recolor fashion set** (without effects, based on existing models) on the main server \u0026 event server.\n  * *(Hat, Suit, Gloves, Boots, Cloak, Mask, 2x Weapon)*\n* These sets will be **bound in the wardrobe** to prevent real-money reselling.\n* The **top donator in November (on the main server)** (determined on 01.12.) will receive:\n  * their regular main server rewards,\n  * the desired recolor set on the main server, and\n  * the same recolor additionally on the Genesis event server.\n* Rare items from earlier top-donator months (e.g. Ripper pets) will **not be reissued on Genesis**, so that everyone can start fairly without huge advantages.\n\n___\n# Premium Shop \u0026 Quality of Life\n\u003e What feels different on Genesis\n\nThe premium shop on Genesis contains some items that differ from the main server – tailored to the temporary nature of the server.\n* There is a new feature allowing you to **send items to offline players** – no more being forced to be online at the same time just to gift something (main \u0026 event server).\n* Some **quality-of-life suggestions from Discord** from recent weeks and months have already been implemented and are active on Genesis.\n* A portion of these QoL changes will later be applied to the main server as well.\n\n___\n# What We Want to Take Away from Genesis\n\u003e Genesis as a tool, not just a one-time show\n\nThe event server is not a gimmick, but a major tool to make Entropia better in the long run. Specifically, we want to:\n***Rebalance early game \u0026 progression** – How quickly can you progress meaningfully? Where does it stall in early/midgame?\n***Understand economy \u0026 prices better** – How do treasures, Perin values, exchanger prices, vote items, etc. develop?\n***Collect balance data** – PvE, PvP, dungeons, boss stats, class performance in a real environment.\n***Establish feedback loops** – targeted feedback threads, surveys after important milestones, clear roadmap communication.\n\n**Strengthen transparency:**\n* We will show clearly which changes on Genesis are only temporary and which insights we will deliberately carry over into the major main server update.\n* A roadmap and preview of selected parts of the upcoming update will be published around **1–2 months before the end of the event server**.\n* Enough to give you a sense of direction – without spoiling every detail ahead of time.\n\n___\n# Frequently Asked Questions \u0026 Concerns (FAQ)\n\u003e Short answers to things many people are currently wondering about.\n\n### Will the main server stay as it is – or are we sacrificing it for Genesis?\nThe main server will remain and will continue to receive events and seasonal activities during Genesis. There is no wipe and no hidden “restart through the back door”.\n* Your currency, your equipment and your progress on the main server remain intact.\n* Genesis runs in parallel and will be integrated into the main server after around five months – your main character is unaffected by that.\n\n### Is Genesis just a “speed server” or test server that gets thrown away afterwards?\nGenesis is not a throwaway speed server. It is time-limited, but fully integrated into our project. It serves as a controlled fresh start with a clear runtime and a firmly planned merge into the main server.\n* Your characters, your gear, and your invested time will be carried over – only specific currencies (e.g. Perin/ECP) will be deliberately reset on merge.\n* Genesis is an expansion chapter, not a separate second server that simply disappears at some point.\n\n### Will there be active work on a main server update while Genesis is running?\nYes. Genesis is specifically intended to give us and you breathing room for a larger, cleaner main server update.\n* While Genesis is running, the team is working in the background on a substantial content update for the main server which goes far beyond normal patches.\n* We don’t have to “cram content in between”, but can plan, test, and connect it to your Genesis experiences in a calm and structured way.\n* This time also serves as a buffer for the team – we are not a full-time studio with no private life, and we want to avoid stress and half-finished solutions.\n\n*At the end of Genesis there will not only be the merge, but also a large main server update that benefits directly from the data collected and your feedback.*\n\n### Can you donate on Genesis? Won’t that become pay2win?\nYou can donate separately on Genesis – but:\n* On Genesis there are only **Blue Diamonds**, which are completely separate from the Red Diamonds on the main server.\n* No one can buy advantages on Genesis with main-server donations.\n* The shop on Genesis is deliberately structured differently: many things are easier to farm and tailored to the temporary nature of the server.\n* After the merge all Blue Diamonds from Genesis will be converted into Red Diamonds on the main server, so your currency will not be wasted.\n\n### Will big donators have a “crazy” advantage on Genesis?\nDonations will always provide some advantage – otherwise we couldn’t finance the server permanently. A long-term project like Entropia comes with ongoing costs: marketing, infrastructure, larger server capacities, external support from freelancers, continuous development and much more. We’re not planning for 1–2 months, but for many years – and that’s exactly why we need a stable foundation to support the server long term.\n\nAt the same time there have always been – and still are – many players on the main server who have reached endgame and some of the strongest characters without ever donating – only through time, knowledge, teamwork and smart investment of their in-game resources.\n\nNonetheless, the advantage from pure donations on Genesis will remain deliberately limited:\n* The most important advantages come from **time, knowledge, teamwork and smart investments**, not just from purchased currency.\n* Currencies such as Perin/ECP will be deliberately reset on merge, while real progression (gear, upgrades, builds) remains.\n* The shop on Genesis is designed so that many things are farmable – a pure “money-only advantage” without gameplay isn’t worth it in the long run.\n\n*Genesis is meant to remain fair – and at the same time provide the basis for Entropia to continue and grow as a long-term project.*\n\n### I have a job, family \u0026 little time – won’t I fall hopelessly behind?\nGenesis is not meant to be a “no-life mandatory grind”.\n***Rates are increased**, certain dungeons are capped, and content is released in **milestones** – no one can “finish everything” in week one.\n* With more active players there will naturally be more leveling services, more trading, and often cheaper entry-level prices.\n* If you have a few days with less time, you can still catch up comfortably – and if you’re not in the mood for Genesis or are waiting for the next milestone, you can simply continue playing on the main server as usual.\n\n### What exactly happens to my characters after the merge?\nYour main server characters remain untouched, and Genesis characters are transferred in a controlled way.\n***Main server:** Your existing characters keep their currency, equipment and all their progress.\n***Genesis:** Your characters will be transferred to the main server – including gear, upgrades, fashion, collections and almost all items.\n* Only some major farm currencies (Perin, Black Perin, Entropia Chips, Entropia Chip Perin) will be deliberately removed to prevent a money flood.\n* If you use the same account, you will simply have more character slots on that account after the merge – but you can also play Genesis on a separate account if you prefer.\n\n### What if I just don’t like the whole concept?\nTo be completely honest: we know that some of you will love Genesis, while others will feel skeptical or even opposed to the concept – that’s normal with a step of this size.\n* The main server remains the heart of the project and your progress there is not devalued.\n* You don’t have to move to the event server if you don’t want a fresh start – you can continue playing on the main server as usual.\n* In the long term, you still benefit: through better balance, clearer progression, a more stable economy, and a larger main server update that builds on the five months of Genesis.\n\n*Genesis is not an “either-or”, but an additional chapter: those who want the event server can dive in fully. Those who prefer to stay on the main server keep their value – and will later feel the benefits of the reworked overall concept.*\n\n___\n# Final Words\n\u003e Genesis – origin and beginning at the same time\n\nOur goal with the Genesis event server is to offer you and ourselves, after almost five years without a wipe, a controlled, one-time fresh start – without destroying the work of the past years and without dropping the main server the way some new servers do. Entropia remains a long-term project. Genesis is the origin of a new chapter, not a replacement.\n\n**We are fully aware that some of you will love Genesis while others will be skeptical or even opposed to the concept – and that’s okay. What matters to us is that no one feels like the main server is being sacrificed for Genesis and that we address your concerns openly.**\n\nWe are taking the time to work on a larger content update instead of “just squeezing things in between”, and we are using these five months to find out, together with you, what Entropia should feel like in the future.\n\nAnother thing that is important to us:\n* Players who are already far into endgame on the current main server will keep their progress and thus still have a noticeable advantage after the merge and the update.\n* Their progress can continue at the start of the event server, since the main server remains actively online for everyone and will also receive events.\n* The main server will remain the heart of our Entropia project!\n* For some of you, certain content will be easier after the event server merge, while for others – who start only on Genesis – it will be more challenging.\n\nThat’s exactly how it should be: **Your long-term commitment to Entropia should continue to pay off**, while new players still get a good entry point and understandable progression.\n\n**Please keep in mind:** The changes mentioned here are only a small part of what has been happening in the background. Many other adjustments, optimizations and quality improvements are deliberately not listed in logs but will gradually show themselves in how the game feels. Just play, try things out, and tell us in upcoming surveys what feels good and where we should adjust further – this feedback helps us the most.\n\n**If you are unsure about specific points or have particular concerns, you’ll find a brief FAQ above the final words where we answer the most common questions about Genesis, the main server, donations, and the upcoming update in a compact way.**\n\n\u003e The event server therefore does not bear its name by accident:\n\u003e **Genesis – origin and beginning at the same time.**",

For example, there is no longer free Shiny gear directly from level-ups, which we added to the main server about half a year ago.\n\nOn Genesis, the early game will be more populated and the market actually matters, so players are meant to spend some time progressing before the next milestone begins.\nWe want early and midgame to feel **meaningful again instead of rushing through everything**, and we’ll keep monitoring feedback and can still fine-tune things if something feels off.\n\n___\n### This beginner guide explains:\n* Basic start: **Buffs, Awakes, Party \u0026 Guild**\n* Leveling from **1–175**\n***Platinum Levels** (175+) \u0026 Genesis milestones\n* How to increase **EXP \u0026 Damage**\n* How to use **Entropia Chip Perin (ECP)** effectively\n***Gear progression (Armor):** Shiny -\u003e Black -\u003e Soulreaver -\u003e Royal\n***Fashion progression:** Dragon -\u003e Black Dragon -\u003e Gaia (fashion only) -\u003e Ultimate -\u003e Omega\n***Weapon progression:** Shiny -\u003e Black -\u003e Soulreaver -\u003e Royal\n***Madrigal Statues**, **Item Wiki**, important **hotkeys** \u0026 **slash commands**\n***Vendor System** (Online/Offline shops)\n***Bonus Upgrade Scrolls** for **Black Shiny** and **Soulreaver** gear\n* A short **Quickstart checklist**\n* Where to get help: **Teleporter, Wiki \u0026 Discord**\n\n\u003e **Skip \u0026 return whenever you like.**\n\u003e This is not a hardcore min-max guide – it is here so that you **never feel completely lost**."

They always work with a **donor item** (with a higher stat) and a **target item** (the item you keep).\n\n**General rule for all these scrolls:**\n* The item on the **left side** of the upgrade window is the **donor**.\n* The item on the **right side** is your **target**.\n* The left‑side item is **destroyed**; its better stat is transferred to the right item.\n\n___\n### 13.1 Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FWLzV8IUkA9qpfnzU3cNW%252FUpgradeScrollEW.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D8741a169-a1eb-4930-b356-3fe253aae4ed\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=3\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=229fd206\u0026sv=2\n\nThe **Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)** is a powerful tool that increases the **bonus stats** of your **Black equipment or weapons**.\n* Especially useful for items that are already **merged** or enhanced.\n* Allows you to push bonuses like **STR, DEX, HP, Crit**, etc. higher.\n\n**How it works – step by step**\n1. **Identify your target item.** (e.g. Black Slayer Helmet +20 STR). This goes on the **right side**.\n2. **Find a compatible donor item.** Same class and part, same stat type but **higher value** (e.g. +22 STR). Can be destroyed/merged.\n3. **Prepare and activate the scroll.** Double‑click the scroll.\n4. **Arrange items.** Left: Donor (Higher stat). Right: Target (Lower stat).\n5. **Execute.** Click the arrow. Left item is destroyed, right item gets the higher stat.\n\n\u003e **Important:** The item on the **left side** of the window is always destroyed.

Right: Original main fusion (lower bonus).\n3. **Execute.** The donor fusion on the left is **destroyed**. Its better fusion stat is transferred to your main fusion on the right.\n\n\u003e **Note:** The entire fusion on the **left side** is destroyed (base + fused item). Always create donor fusions specifically for upgrades.\n\n___\n### 13.3 Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FzwYqAPVeF900H0JYIyjb%252FUpgradeScrollEWSR.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da4e9b820-9ef9-46f0-92e5-3e7999645951\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=3\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=4e54046\u0026sv=2\n\nThe **Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)** is the Soulreaver equivalent of the Black Shiny scrolls.

It is a relaxed way to farm useful items while exploring Flarine, Saint City and Darkon.\n\n### 14.1 How it works\n***Collector** – A device that you deploy in designated collection areas to gather materials over time.\n***Batteries** – Fuel for your Collector. Different battery types can give very different rewards.\n***Collection Areas** – Collectorfields in **Flarine, Saint City and Darkon**.\n***Rewards** – Materials that can be exchanged for **Power‑Ups, Collector Chips** and other forms of Collector currency.\n***Collector Master** – NPC near each Collectorfield where you can trade materials for rewards.\n\n### 14.2 Collector IP Lock\nTo keep things fair, there is a **Collector IP Lock** limiting the use of Collectors to **10 characters per IP**. This ensures equal opportunities for everyone.\n\n### 14.3 Collector Batteries\nThere are many different **Collector Batteries**, and the battery you use strongly affects the rewards you get.\n* Some batteries are easy to obtain, others require more effort.\n* “Stronger” batteries usually mean **better, more valuable drops**.\n* Choosing the right battery for your goal (power‑ups, materials, currency) is a big part of the strategy.\n\n### 14.4 Tips for maximizing rewards\n***Research first:** Check the Wiki or ask other players which Collector rewards are currently valuable.\n***Plan your batteries:** Use batteries that match what you need most (power‑ups, chips, currency, materials).\n***Check regularly:** Visit your Collectorfield often to swap batteries and collect your items.\n***Exchange smartly:** Trade materials at the Collector Master when prices or your needs are best, instead of instantly dumping everything."

It uses **Infinity Stones** and **Infinity Points (IP)** to enhance your character over time.\nYou can find Athena in **Flarine** near the Postbox/Bank office or by teleporting to the entrance of the **Heaven of Madrigal** dungeon.\n\n### 15.1 Earning Infinity Points\nYou gain Infinity Points (IP) from many activities:\n* Defeating regular monsters throughout Madrigal.\n* Killing **boss monsters**.\n* Completing **daily quests** in Kebaria \u0026 Aurania.\n* Harvesting in the **Collectorfield**.\n* Participating in **Guild Siege / Rumble**.\n* Recycling unwanted **Infinity Stones**.\n\n**Boosting IP – Infinity IP‑Stone**\nThe **Infinity IP‑Stone**, available from the Vote Shop, doubles your earned Infinity Points for **one hour**. It is perfect for farm sessions when you want to push your Infinity Grid.\n\n**Weekly farm limit**\nYou can collect up to **5,000,000 Infinity Points** per week.\n\n### 15.2 Understanding the Infinity Grid\nThe Infinity Grid is made of **outer stones** and **middle crystals**.\n***Outer Stones**: These stones sit on the rim of the grid and give **1 to 5 random status values** each. Inserting or removing them costs roughly **7,500–25,000 IP** depending on the stone.\n***Middle Crystals**: Core nodes that every character starts with. They can be **upgraded indefinitely** using Infinity Points, giving permanent scaling to your stats.\n\n### 15.3 Infinity Stones \u0026 where to get them\nInfinity Stones, used for the outer slots, mainly drop from:\n***Kingdom Heaven of Madrigal dungeon** – the primary source with the best drop rates.\n***Older dungeons** – still have a chance to drop Infinity Stones, but at a lower rate.\n\nUse the **Droplist** from the Teleporter to see where specific stones can drop and to plan your runs.\nEach Infinity Stone can roll **1–5 random effects** (for example: multiple STR+1 lines, combinations like INT+1, Speed+1%, DEX+2, etc.). If you don’t like the result, you can remove the stone again and try a new one.\n\n### 15.4 Strategy \u0026 further reading\nThe Infinity Grid is designed as a **long‑term progression system**. By carefully choosing which crystals to upgrade and which stones to use, you can tailor your character for:\n* Maximum damage output.\n* Tankiness \u0026 survivability.\n* Utility, hybrid or support playstyles.\n\nExperiment with different stone combinations, recycle bad stones for IP and slowly push your middle crystals to higher levels.\n\n\u003e **For a full deep‑dive:**\n\u003e Check the dedicated [[🌐 Infinity Grid]] page in the Wiki."

Once you have accumulated a certain number, you can exchange them for an Augmentation at the Entropia Chip NPC.**\n* These scrolls should not be massively farmed, because they can also be acquired in the Premium Dungeon, Guild War, Daily Rewards, Events or other gimmicks.\n* Due to this further change, we will offer these old augmentations in the store from time to time as limited offers, especially since this doesn\u0027t really give any advantages in the new endgame content, because you need new ones there, which can only be farmed there through dungeons or other activities.\n**• More power-ups have been added to the Guild Siege Buff Box.**\n* This also applies to seasonal event items such as Easter eggs or Halloween candy.\n* At the respective events, these are temporarily removed from the box again, so that players have to earn them again.\n* Power-ups from special boxes or those that can be easily farmed were not added.\n**• The Awake Transfer Scroll now shows the correct values when you place a weapon without fusion in the window and transfer the values from it to an item with fusion.

We have a Platinum Level system that can be increased up to level 175 and 99.99% experience by using Platinum Level scrolls. These scrolls can be obtained for free or from an NPC in Flaris. Platinum levels do not provide additional stats, but players will receive items that give stats such as Stat Pets or Accessories for their character. Platinum Level 50 is the highest level that can be achieved through leveling. Players can reach higher levels by completing daily quests, activities, and dungeons. Reaching higher Platinum levels will also unlock additional rewards from the Donate Shop or valuable chests. With the \"Myths of Cardia\" patch, we introduced the Royal Level system for our endgame players. This system works similarly to the Platinum Level system, but increasing the Royal Level unlocks more game content (2 new level maps and a large zone with different biomes) and strengthens the character with new stats. The Royal Level system has a very low experience rate, but it can be increased through EXP items and occasional Royal EXP events.\n***If anyone is wondering how leveling works for new players: Please also check our **[[🔥 Beginner Guide]]-\u003e Reach level 175.\n- \u003e Platinum level in various areas and receive platinum rewards that strengthen the character.\n- \u003e From Platinum 40, the EXP curve is significantly lowered.\n- \u003e P50 is the last platinum level.\n- \u003e All further platinum levels above P50 are just bonuses that can be leveled through tasks and dungeons.\n- \u003e After reaching Platinum 50, the new Royal Level System is introduced, which is built on a low rate but can also be increased with power-ups.\n- \u003e Obtain Soulreaver weapons / equipment because otherwise, no damage can be done to the Royal Monsters.\n- \u003e RL. 0 to 1 = Complete quests (1-2h)\n- \u003e RL. 1 to 6 = Leveling (A bit longer)\n- \u003e RL. 6 to 10 = Complete quests (1-3 days depending on playtime / whether you quest solo or in a group)\n- \u003e Get Royal equipment / weapons which can be worn from RL. 10.\n- \u003e RL. 10 to 15 = Longer leveling, but can be postponed unless one wants to unlock the Trance Mode / Soulreaver Power-Up.\n- \u003e RL. 15 to 20 = Longer Leveling on the best Penya Farm Map, where you can get additional Items and access to two of the RL. 15 Dungeons.\n\n**Drop Rate: 8000x (Custom in Mid / Endgame - So that it\u0027s not to much)**In addition to our balancements and existing drops and rates, we have added numerous new drops and items throughout Madrigal and our custom content.\nMany dungeons are also designed so that you can farm the respective currency from the regular monsters to obtain something.\n\n**Penya Rate: 4000x**Our revised currency system offers a wide range of possibilities for earning and spending Penya. While the rate may seem overpowered at first, players will be surprised by the numerous opportunities available to them.\nJob classes that play as 1-on-1 receive double the amount of Penya per killed monster compared to job classes that use AoE skills for farming. This is because AoE classes can acquire very high Penya amounts, and we want to give something back to 1-on-1 players. Despite receiving half the amount per monster, AoE classes farm faster because they can kill multiple monsters in a shorter amount of time.\n\n* [[✨ Last Main Content Patch]]\n* [[Current PvE Meta]]",

What should I do?\n\n**Answer:**There could be several reasons for this issue. It could be due to an outdated client, lack of read/write access to the Entropia client folder, or missing drivers. Some operating systems also block certain paths such as the download folder, which is only intended for downloads. Therefore, try moving your Entropia client to the desktop or to C:\\Programs.\nIf the issue persists, right-click on the Entropia folder and select \"Properties\" followed by the \"Security\" tab. Check if the permissions for \"Read\" and \"Write\" have check marks. If not, edit them and give the folder full access so that Windows can use it without any problems.\nIf the issue still persists, try patching your game via the patcher/launcher but do not start the game through it. Instead, close the patcher/launcher and delete the following files in your client **if** they exist - normaly they should not be there:\n• d3d9.dll in the Entropia\\bin32 and Entropia\\bin64 folder.\n• d3dx9_43.dll in the Entropia\\bin32 and Entropia\\bin64 folder.\nAfter deleting these files, start the game using the **start_64bit.bat** or **start_32bit.bat** file located in your client folder. This ensures that the game can be started without the patcher/launcher.\n\nAlso make sure that you have the required drivers installed for our game:\n• Visual C++ Redistributable Packages 2015 / 2017:****[**Microsoft Download**](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)\n• DirectX (9.0c) End-User Runtimes (June 2010):****[**Microsoft Download**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)\nLastly, it\u0027s worth checking if an exception for Entropia has been added to your antivirus software. If not, add it to the exception list to prevent the antivirus from blocking any necessary files.\n**If you\u0027re still experiencing issues, please read through this section:**[**Click me!**](my-game-does-not-launch.html)****\n**Please also make sure that your folder looks like this and that you have downloaded it again \u0026 use a fresh game client:**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FvYTDgx6.png\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=fe2edcf3\u0026sv=2\nMake sure that your game folder looks like this!",

This can be quite frustrating, as it can disrupt the gameplay experience and, in some cases, even result in penalties or loss of progress. Here\u0027s a tutorial on how to add a game as an exception in your windows firewall and how using a VPN can help with reducing your ping if you live far away from the game server:\n**Adding the game as an exception in your firewall:**\nFirewall software can sometimes interfere with the connection between your game and the game server. To prevent this, you can add the game as an exception in your firewall settings.\n**a. For Windows Firewall:**\nCopy\n1. Open the Control Panel by searching for it in the Start menu.\n2. Click on \"System and Security,\" then \"Windows Defender Firewall.\"\n3. On the left pane, click \"Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall.\"\n4. Click \"Change settings\" and then \"Allow another app.\"\n5. Browse for the game executable file (usually found in the game\u0027s installation folder) and click \"Open.\"\n6. Ensure both \"Private\" and \"Public\" boxes are checked, then click \"OK.\"\n**b. For third-party firewall software (VPNs, Servers):**\nCopy\nThe process will vary depending on the software you are using. Please refer to the specific instructions provided by the software\u0027s developer.\n**Using a VPN to improve connectivity:**\nIf you live far away from the game server, latency and packet loss can become significant issues. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can help by routing your connection through a server that is closer to the game server, thereby reducing latency and improving overall connection stability.\nWe recommend to use the ExitLag VPN, which most of our Players use, but you can also try out a different one. ExitLag VPN also has a Free 3-Day Trial!\na. Choose a reputable VPN provider with servers in the region where the game server is located (France). b. Install the VPN software on your computer. c. Launch the VPN and connect to a server in the desired region. d. Start your game and check for improvements in latency and overall connection stability.\nPlease note that while a VPN can help in certain situations, it may not always result in better performance. Some game servers may even block or restrict VPN connections (Entropia Allows it), so it\u0027s essential to verify that the VPN you are using is compatible with the game you are playing.\nBy following these steps, you can potentially reduce the occurrence of Ghost DCs in your gaming experience, leading to a smoother and more enjoyable time while playing.\n**If the disconnections in Entropia still persist, try to add Entropia as an exception in your Antivirus:\n\nGuides to add exceptions:**• **Windows-Defender:** [https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj](https://bit.ly/2yIGhAj)\n• **Avira:** [https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG](https://bit.ly/3YAC1tG)\n• **Avast:** [https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt](https://bit.ly/2zvrjxt)\n• **Bitdefender:** [https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn](https://bit.ly/3GbvNtn)\n• **McAfee:** [https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4](https://bit.ly/35Oc8f4)\n\nMake an Exception for:\nEntropia (Whole Folder)\nEntropia\\Launcher.exe\nEntropia\\Updater.exe\nEntropia\\bin32\\Neuz.exe\nEntropia\\bin64\\Neuz.exe\n\nIt can be that you need to restart your Computer after that.\n\nIt may also be helpful to re-download the game, not launch it yet, and first add the exceptions in your antivirus software. After doing so, perform a computer restart before launching the game.",

Start by launching the game and accessing its settings menu (Start -\u003e Options). b. Look for graphics or performance settings, and set the resolution, texture quality, and other options according to your hardware capabilities. If you have a powerful CPU and GPU, setting the options to High might help fully utilize your system, while a weaker system might require lower settings for better performance.\n2. **Optimize Windows power settings:**a. Right-click on the battery icon in the system tray (bottom right corner) and select \"Power Options.\" b. In the Power Options window, choose the \"High Performance\" plan. If it\u0027s not visible, click on \"Show additional plans\" to reveal it. c. Close the window. This will ensure that your computer\u0027s power settings do not throttle your game performance.\n3. **Update your graphics drivers:**a. Visit your GPU manufacturer\u0027s website (NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) and download the latest graphics drivers for your specific model. b. Install the drivers and restart your computer for the changes to take effect.\n4. **Optimize your GPU settings:**a. Open your GPU\u0027s control panel (NVIDIA Control Panel, AMD Radeon Settings, or Intel Graphics Control Panel). b. Locate the settings related to gaming or 3D applications, and adjust them for better performance. For example, you may want to enable \"Prefer Maximum Performance\" in the NVIDIA Control Panel or \"High Performance\" in AMD Radeon Settings.\n5. **Disable unnecessary background processes:**a. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager. b. Click on the \"Processes\" tab, and sort the list by CPU or memory usage. c. Carefully close any non-essential processes that are consuming significant resources.\n6. **Adjust in-game settings:**As mentioned earlier, setting the game options to High instead of Low can help fully utilize your CPU. This is particularly true for systems with powerful CPUs and GPUs, as running the game on low settings might cause the CPU to wait for the GPU, resulting in lower overall performance. Experiment with different settings to find the best balance between performance and visual quality for your specific hardware.\nBy following these steps, you can optimize your gaming experience and achieve the best possible performance based on your computer hardware. Remember that every game and system is different, so you may need to tweak these recommendations to match your unique setup.\n**Entropia** is a One core CPU-based game with some quirks (and the drawbacks that come with being a One core CPU-based game). Although the performance in Entropia has been significantly improved, the older base code of the game prevents a massive overhaul. As a result, particularly in cities with many players, frame (FPS) drops may occur due to the Glow effects (SFX) that need to be loaded and rendered. This process consumes a lot of performance, as it is only handled by a single core of your CPU.\nA One core CPU-based game like this can suffer from performance issues because it relies heavily on a single core of the processor to handle most of the game\u0027s tasks. This means that even if you have a multi-core processor, the game won\u0027t take full advantage of the additional cores, resulting in limited performance improvements. Consequently, players might experience slowdowns, especially in areas where there is a high concentration of players and visual effects, such as cities.\nOtherwise, for some locations, you can permanently, temporarily, or partially hide players, pets, and glow effects in your in-game options to achieve more frames (FPS).\nAdditionally, you can **use the keybinding Ctrl + P to toggle hiding and displaying players** if you experience lag in crowded areas with many players.",

This is due to the file size being too large for the standard software to handle. In this tutorial, we\u0027ll explore why this happens and demonstrate how to use alternative programs like 7-Zip or WinRAR to unpack the game client. We will focus on 7-Zip, as the game client was originally compressed using this software.\n1. Why Standard Unzipping Software Struggles with Large Game Clients: Standard unzipping software, like the built-in Windows extraction tool, can struggle to unpack large game client files for several reasons:a. Memory limitations: These programs are designed for simple tasks and may not have the memory capacity to handle large files. b. File size limitations: Some standard unzipping software may impose a file size limit, preventing the extraction of large game clients. c. Compatibility issues: The game client might have been compressed using a different algorithm or format, making it difficult for the standard software to recognize and extract the files.\n2. The Benefits of Using 7-Zip or WinRAR: Using alternative software like 7-Zip or WinRAR can help you overcome these limitations:a. Better memory management: These programs are designed to handle larger files and use more efficient memory allocation techniques. b. No file size limitations: Both 7-Zip and WinRAR can handle large files, making them suitable for extracting large game clients. c. Compatibility: These programs can recognize a wider range of compression formats and algorithms, increasing the chances of successfully extracting the game client.\n3. Unpacking the Game Client with 7-Zip: Since the game client was compressed with 7-Zip, we will focus on using this software to unpack it.a. Download and install 7-Zip: Visit the 7-Zip website ([https://www.7-zip.org/](https://www.7-zip.org/)) and download the appropriate version for your system. Install the software by following the on-screen instructions.b. Locate the game client file: Find the compressed game client file on your computer. It should have a file extension like .7z or .zip.c. Right-click the game client file: After locating the file, right-click on it to bring up a context menu. In this menu, select \u00277-Zip\u0027 and then \u0027Extract Here\u0027 or \u0027Extract to \"folder_name\"\u0027. This will start the extraction process.d. Wait for extraction to complete: Depending on the size of the game client and your computer\u0027s performance, this process may take some time. Be patient and wait for the extraction to finish.e. Run the game: Once the extraction is complete, navigate to the extracted folder and locate the game executable file (usually with a .exe extension). Double-click the file to launch the game.\nConclusion: If you encounter issues unpacking a large game client using the standard unzipping software on your computer, consider using alternative programs like 7-Zip or WinRAR. In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use 7-Zip to extract a large game client. By following these steps, you can successfully unpack and play your game without any issues.",

The world of Kebaria and Aurania offers endless adventures for those looking to push the limits. Here’s what you can do beyond Platinum Level 50:\n___\n### Continue the Adventure\n***Level Beyond Platinum Level 50:**Leveling up beyond Platinum Level 50 is optional. Continue to earn Activity EXP through diverse in-game activities to unlock new challenges and rewards.\n___\n### How to Earn Activity EXP for P50+ ~ P100+\n***Dungeon Runs:**Team up with friends or other players to conquer challenging dungeons.\n***Complete Daily Quests:**Kebaria and Aurania are filled with daily quests that yield generous Activity EXP and rewards.\n***Participate in Events:**Join server-side events like the Guild War for a unique chance to earn additional EXP and exclusive items.\n___\n### Boost Your Progress\n* Take advantage of power-ups or buffs available during weekend events to speed up your Activity EXP gain.\n___\n### Gear Up\n***Farm Guild Activities:**Participate in activities like Battlegrounds or Guild Siege to get some goodies and Buffs.\n***Join Dungeons:**Dive into custom content dungeons for exclusive gear and challenges.\nEmbark on this next phase of your journey with confidence. The path ahead is filled with opportunities to strengthen your character and forge lasting alliances. Ready, set, grind!\n___\n## Equipment / Weapon Route\n***Early:**Shiny Set / Weapons (Les Britannia / Abyssal Cove Dungeon)\n***Midgame:**Black Shiny Set / Weapons (Kebaria / Aurania Map)\n***Late Midgame:**Soulreaver Set / Weapons (Ethral / Trigrem)\n***Endgame:**Royal Set / Weapons (Cardia \u0026 RL 10+ Dungeons)\nFrom Shiny onwards, you\u0027ll need the current set to reach the next weapon/equipment level. You\u0027ll then have to merge your Shiny with destroyed Black Shiny items to create a intact Black Shiny item part, which you can then wear for higher effects.\nThe bonus stats from the Shiny set won\u0027t be carried over when merging with a destroyed Black Shiny part.\nWhen merging Black Shiny with a destroyed Soulreaver item, the bonuses from the Black Shiny part will combine with the Soulreaver part, giving you two bonus stats on your new part.\nYou\u0027ll need the Soulreaver set and weapons if you\u0027re leveling up from Royal Level 0 to 10 yourself. Only with the Soulreaver weapons can you deal damage to the monsters!\nFor endgame Royal equipment, you won\u0027t need to merge your equipment anymore. The Soulreaver items can then be converted into a special HP \u0026 damage buff, which becomes stronger if you have good Soulreaver equipment.\n___\n### Comprehensive Upgrades\n***Beyond Equipment:**Upgrade not only your equipment but also pets, accessories, and fashion equipment. Each starts at a base tier and can be incrementally improved to higher versions through farming or upgrading.\nThis guide should serve as a foundational reference for your in-game advancement, focusing on both character progression and comprehensive equipment upgrades.\n___\n## Royal Level System Guide\nIf you\u0027re new to the game or prefer a standard progression route, there\u0027s no immediate need to concern yourself with the Endgame Royal Level System. It becomes relevant once you achieve a very Good Equipment and Platinum Level 50 or higher, at which point you can initiate a Royal Questline in Flarine. Completing this questline advances you from Royal Level 0 to 1.\nTo effectively combat Royal Level monsters, it\u0027s essential to acquire Soulreaver weapons and equipment, previously considered endgame items, from the Ethral/Trigrem region. Preparing for this challenge is a significant undertaking and will be detailed in a separate, dedicated guide.",

The bonus on these items doesn’t really matter as they won’t transfer to your black equipment upon merging, but the higher the stat the more damage or HP you’ll obtain.\nShiny Entropia Weapons Weapons can be bought for 100 ECP each ([which you’ll earn when levelling to platinum level 50](beginner-guide/what-comes-after-level-175.html#platin-level-rewards)) at Weapon Trader Charly in Flaris.\n___\n### Upgrading your Shiny Gear:\nYou’ll want to upgrade your weapon and equipment to at least +10. You can do this in Flaris at the Upgrade Specialist BoboChan. Choose the safe upgrade option. For your weapon you will need shiny oricalkum (you get these dropped when killing monsters) and scrolls of XProtect (can be bought at Cash Shop Laura in Flaris. For your equipment you’ll need sunstones (dropped when killing monsters) and scrolls of SProtect (buyable at Laura NPC).\nYou’ll also want to pierce your suit (4 times) and weapons (10 times). You can also do this at BoboChan. In order to do this you’ll need moonstones (dropped from killing monsters) and scrolls of GProtect (buyable at Laura NPC). All classes (except for magic classes) will need to put an element on their weapon and suit for maximum damage. You can also do this at BoboChan. For this you will need Elemental Cards and scrolls of GProtect from Laura again. A and 7% cards can be bought at Jewel Manager Peach in Flaris. Better cards can be bought from players or farmed in Rhisis’ Trail. You might already want to put diamonds in your weapon. You can do this at Jewel Exchanger Peach in Flaris. Diamonds can be bought or farmed in numerous dungeons (press V and check the drop log in the teleporter to see which dungeons drop the diamonds). Inserting diamonds never fails.\n**Also Check the Shiny Content Area in our Wiki:** [Shiny](../custom-content/shiny.html)\n___\n## Black Shiny Entropia Equipment Dungeon:\nMagma Cave The boss drops individual set parts, so try your luck!\nBlack Shiny Entropia Weapon Dungeon: Aurania Temple The boss drops black weapon materials and the occasional black shiny weapon box. The black material can be exchanged at Aurania Quest Exchanger Tina for those weapon boxes. The bonuses on these equipment parts and weapons matter, not only for damage and HP purposes but also in endgame for your [soulreaver sacrifice](../systems/soulreaver-sacrifice.html).\n___\n### Merging Shiny to Black:\nFor merging your equipment you’ll need scrolls of armour merge which can be found at Kebaria Exchange Maria. By using the scroll of armour merge (special), you’ll get to keep your awakenings when merging from shiny to black, if you use the normal scrolls, your awakenings will be lost and you’ll have to reawaken your Black Shiny Set. Upgrade levels and cards are kept. For merging your weapons you’ll need scrolls of weapon merge which can be found at the Aurania Quest Exchanger Tina. Upgrade levels and cards are kept. Diamonds will be lost unless you use magic diamonds to remove the diamonds at BoboChan before merging. This isn’t recommended though unless you are using spirit diamonds already.\n**Tutorial for Black Equipment Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-black-shiny-equipment.html)\n**Tutorial for Black Weapons Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-black-weapon.html)\n___\n### Upgrading your Black Shiny Gear:\nIf you haven’t already, you’ll want to upgrade your Black Shiny Equipment and Weapons to +20. From levels 1 to 10 you’ll use shiny oricalkum and scrolls of XProtect for weapons and sunstones and scrolls of SProtect for set pieces. From 10 – 20 you’ll need scrolls of UProtect (Ultra) and ultra sunstones (weapon and equipment). You can get these items at the shiny dungeon exchangers or buy them from players. Don’t forget to insert diamonds in your weapons if you haven’t already!\n**Also Check the Black Shiny Content Area in our Wiki:** [Black](../custom-content/black.html)\n___\n## Soulreaver Equipment:\nDungeon: Trigrem Ruins\nThe boss drops individual set parts.\n___\n## Soulreaver Weapons:\nDungeon: Ethral Garden\nThe boss drops Soulreaver Relics and the occasional soulreaver weapon box.\nThese relics can be exchanged for weapon boxes at the NPC exchanger Raziel in Ethral.\n**Also Check the Soulreaver Content Area in our Wiki:** [Soulreaver](../custom-content/soulreaver.html)\n___\n## Merging Black to Soulreaver:\nFor merging your equipment you’ll need scrolls which can be found at the Trigrem Exchanger Soran. For merging your weapons you’ll need scrolls of weapon merge (soulreaver) which can be found at the Ethral Exchanger Raziel.\n\n**Tutorial for Soulreaver Equipment Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-soulreaver-equipment.html)\n**Tutorial for Soulreaver Weapon Merging:** [Click Here!](../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system/how-do-i-merge-a-soulreaver-weapon.html)\n___\n## Royal Equipment \u0026 Weapons!\nAfter Soulreaver, players can look forward to unlocking Royal Equipment and Weapons. These items do not require merging of previous items like the Soulreaver. They become available for equipping once a player reaches Royal Level 10, or at Level 6 for those using a Boost Token.\n\nWeapons and equipment can be acquired as drops from the Destruction Cavern or Azmore Forest Dungeon. Additionally, Loot Orbs, which may contain one of these items randomly, can also be obtained. Alternatively, you can purchase them from other players using in-game currency.\nFor players aiming to progress from Royal Level 0 to 10 without utilizing boosts, the Soulreaver is crucial. Monsters cannot be damaged without a Soulreaver Weapon, and without a high-quality Soulreaver Set, your HP may not withstand the Monsters\u0027 attacks.\nFurthermore, the previously mentioned Soulreaver equipment and weapons become necessary for crafting special power-ups and a unique character mode (Trance) as you progress further in the game, starting from Royal Level 15. The quality of your Soulreaver set determines the strength of the buffs you receive.\n\n**Other Royal / Cardia Area Information:**\n[What should I do after i reached Royal Level 6?](level-boost-token-royal-level-6/what-should-i-do-after-i-reached-royal-level-6.html)\n[Royal Level 6 / Level Boost Token](level-boost-token-royal-level-6.html)\n[Cardia Patch / Introduction of Royal Levels](https://entropia.fun/index.php?site=news\u0026newsid=701)\n**Other Wiki Informations:** [Royal](../custom-content/royal.html)",

You can check out the NPC Aoife in central Flaris near the post office to see what items are needed to create this set. Or you can buy a Gaia Coupon from players and then trade Aoife in Flaris to the set you need.\n___\n## Ultimate Fashion Set\nTo craft your ultimate fashion set, you’ll need the Ultimate Entropia Fashion Bundle (crafting).

It allows players to skip the grind and instantly access the latest Early Endgame content, the Cardia Beginning.\n___\n## Can i access the Content without the Token?\nYes! The token is only optional for players who want to save time by skipping everything beforehand. Otherwise, it takes several weeks or months, depending on your playtime, to reach this area. Most players have reached it even before the token was available!\nYou decide how you want to play. However, we don\u0027t want to deny players the opportunity to play our latest content, which some older players had already experienced years ago and may not want to repeat.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t been boosted and have reached Royal Level 6 by yourself, you can also continue with this Guide in this section to see how you should proceed, or you can look in the [Royal](../custom-content/royal.html) section of our wiki.\n___\n## More Detailed Informations\nHere in the wiki, it\u0027s briefly outlined, but if you want to know all the details about the boost, please visit our news section [here](https://entropia.fun/index.php?site=news\u0026newsid=942).\n___\n## How Does It Work?\nUpon using the Level Boost Token, you will receive a temporary basic equipment package, enabling you to jump straight into the action. This package includes:\n* Instantly reaching Royal Level 6 and Platinum 50, unlocking job class selection.\n* Access to Cardia and story quests to advance your character to Royal Level 10.\n* Unlocking endgame content dungeons at Royal Level 10.\n* Time-limited Royal Blood \u0026 Darkness Set and weapons.\n* Standard DMG \u0026 HP Boost Jewelry Set for collecting normal equipment.\n* Random Platinum 50 Pet and power-ups/items for an enjoyable start.\n* Dark Adventurer Set for cosmetic purposes.\n___\n## Important Notes:\n***Boost packages are designed to complement, not replace, older game content.**\n* Players can still level up without payment, but the boost offers a shortcut.**The Main Reason for that Boost.**\n* Boost Token is one-time use and applicable only for characters under Royal Level 6.\n___\n## Is It Worth It?\nDeciding whether to use the Level Boost Token depends on your playstyle and preferences. Consult with the community or our team to make an informed decision. You can still experience the older content and eventually reach the boosted area without purchasing the level boost token, but it may take some time, as is typical in any MMO. Ultimately, you\u0027re here to have fun and manage your time as you see fit! So, just relax and enjoy the game! :)\n___\n## Ready to Boost?\nIf you\u0027re level 175 or below, simply purchase the Level Boost Token from the Premium Shop and choose your desired class. Make sure your inventory isn\u0027t full to receive all items.\n___\n## Remember\n* Boost items have a time limit of 30 days.\n* Boost Token can only be used once per character and is not applicable beyond Royal Level 6.\n* You\u0027ll immediately dive into the Early Endgame, so remember that it\u0027s challenging and requires various activities for progression, such as questing to level, do daily quests, dungeon runs, perin farming, and more. The drop rates in the Endgame are customized and slightly higher than official rates, offering an engaging and rewarding experience.\n* Also, keep in mind that you\u0027ll also need items from older content. This Level Boost is just to get you started on the initial new content and don\u0027t fully skip the older content, so you\u0027ll still require some older items to strengthen your character. We elaborate on this on the following page:[**Progression after Reaching Royal Level 10**](level-boost-token-royal-level-6/progression-after-reaching-royal-level-10.html)\n___\n## Get Ready to Conquer Cardia!\nNow that you\u0027re equipped with the Level Boost Token knowledge, it\u0027s time to embark on your adventure. Whether you\u0027re a new player or a seasoned veteran, this shortcut will help you reach new heights in no time!",

Are there specific monsters to kill for leveling up?\nNo, you won\u0027t level up by defeating monsters. Instead, you\u0027ll progress from Royal Level 6 to 10 by completing quests in Cardia. You\u0027ll need to complete all quests given by the following NPCs to reach Royal Level 10:\n* [Quest] Lilly - Located near the sea in Cardia Harbor**If you have issues to find this Quest Items by using the Quest Description, you can Spoiler yourself here with the Location Spots:*[**Click Here!**](https://imgur.com/yKi1Djy):)\n* [Hunt Quest] Gavin - Found next to the Cardia Harbor spawn point\n* [Mineralogist] Rowan - Located near the windmill in Cardia Harbor\n* [Plant Expert] Eugene - Positioned in the middle of Cardia Harbor\n* [Story Quest] Aldwin - Situated on the left side of Cardia close to Cardia Harbor\n* [Quest] Zuah - Located in front of the Cardia Cave\n* [Quest] Bharc - Inside the Cardia Cave\n**Additionally, complete the following daily quests once:**\n* [Daily Quest] Raimond the Fearless\n* [Daily Quest] Lord Pang",

Here\u0027s a comprehensive guide on what to do next:\n___\n## Focus on Farming Older Content\nFarm older content items to boost your character\u0027s values further. Sacrifice Soulreaver Armor with good bonus values to obtain damage and HP power-ups after Reaching Royal Level 15. It therefore makes sense to farm it even incidentally as you progress gradually through the Royal area. Additionally, unlock the Trance Mode, which can be activated periodically through monster kills and filling your trance/limit bar above your character.\n**Importance of Old Content Items in Endgame and for New Players**\nOld content items remain a crucial aspect of gameplay, even in the endgame. These items are necessary for several important activities, such as:\n***Sacrifices**: Certain endgame processes require old content items as offerings.\n***Creating Permanent Reroll Effect Stones**: These stones streamline the bonus reroll system for \"Royal +10\" items, significantly aiding in endgame optimization.\nNew players, especially those who choose not to use boosts and progress through the game at a standard pace, also find value in acquiring these items. Whether for crafting, selling, or specific quests, old content items retain their usefulness across all stages of the game, highlighting their enduring value in both early and late game scenarios.\n___\n## Obtain Permanent Ultimate and Omega Items\nAim to acquire permanent Ultimate and Omega Fashion Items. Obtain glyphs, fairies, and power-ups by obtaining Entropia Treasures through various activities such as daily quests, dungeon runs, and server events. Here is a guide on how you can obtain those items without purchasing them from other players: [Ultimate Items](../../sets-weapons-and-items/ultimate-items.html)\n___\n## Acquire Permanent Soulreaver Accessories\nObtain permanent Soulreaver accessories for your class from the Deep Temple Dungeon or other Players and upgrade them to +10 through farming. These accessories can be exchanged for Royal Accessories in the Endgame with Royal Level 15 by gathering the required materials in the Dread Cove Isle Dungeons. Additionally, you will need a replacement for the Boost Accessory, as it is only available for 30 days and you will not receive a new one on that character anymore the Soulreaver Accessorie is the best way to go at that point.\n___\n## Farm Upgrade Materials\nGather upgrade materials to enhance your permanent Royal equipment. Focus on upgrading your permanent gear and weapons, as the boosted 30-day equipment received as a head start has limited duration.\n___\n## Farm Infinity Points\nKill monsters to farm Infinity Points and upgrade your Infinity Grid with additional stats. You can even obtain the required stones for upgrading in the Heaven of Madrigal Dungeon, which provides additional stat boosts.\n___\n## Objective\n**Advance to Royal Level 15** to unlock and experience the lucrative opportunities and enthralling challenges that lie within the Dread Cove Isle Map.\n___\n## Leveling from Royal Level 10 to 15 in the Amethyst Forest\nTo efficiently level up from Royal Level 10 to 15, follow these steps in the **Amethyst Forest** level map, accessible via our teleporter at Royal Level 10.\n___\n### Collect Royal EXP Items\n***Location:**Initially, begin your search in**Cardia**for Royal EXP items. These items are crucial for augmenting your experience gains.\n***Other Sources:**Additionally, consider obtaining Royal EXP Scrolls from other players or purchasing them from the Premium Shop. These scrolls significantly boost your leveling process.\n___\n### Key Points to Remember\n* The**EXP Rate**within the Amethyst Forest is notably lower compared to the early game areas. This is due to it being an endgame area, offering a challenging yet rewarding experience. Keep in mind, you do not start in Flaris; this is the endgame content.\n* Persistently farm in the designated area until you reach Royal Level 15.\n* Enhance Your Character with Exclusive Damage, HP and EXP Power-Ups, which are not available in the regular boost packages or are specific to seasonal events or older content. Moreover, take advantage of weekend events to accelerate your level progression efficiently.\n___\n### Accessing Dread Cove Isle Map\nUpon reaching Royal Level 15, you\u0027ll gain access to the new **Dread Cove Isle Level Map to Royal Level 20**. This location is esteemed as the premier Penya farming spot within Entropia Flyff. The Dread Cove Isle Map not only introduces new dungeons to explore but also presents an array of challenges to conquer.\n___\n## Adventure Pass Quests\nEvery 3 to 4 months, we offer an Adventure Pass (Battle Pass) in the Premium Shop, which can also be purchased by other players. There, you will receive a custom questline that you can complete with Lord Pang in Flarine.\nFor each quest, you will receive useful rewards for your character, and at the end, always a Fashion Set with very useful effects, which have an exclusive appearance. Additionally, there are extra exclusive models available there.\nRecently, such Adventure Passes have been introduced for midgame and endgame players, each containing different quests.\nYou can find more detailed information about the Adventure Pass on our Wiki: [**Click Here!**](../../systems/adventure-pass.html)\n___\n## World Boss Hunt\nDefeat world boss monsters that spawn at fixed and random times! You will receive useful items needed for the Royal area.\nRecently, starting from Royal Level 6, you will also receive a Hunter\u0027s Badge, which you can use with Lord Pang in Cardia to obtain additional rewards for your character.\n___\n## Daily Activities\nComplete the daily quests in Cardia and occasionally those from Kebaria or Aurania as needed. In Cardia, you\u0027ll obtain important items, while in Kebaria and Aurania, you\u0027ll receive items from older content necessary for crafting certain items such as normal jewelry pieces, specific furniture with status effects, other useful power-ups, and more.\n**With these tips in mind, you\u0027re ready to embark on the next phase of your adventure in Entropia Flyff. Enjoy the journey and make the most of your Royal Level 10 progression!**",

The process requires combining various ingredients, each with its unique properties, to complete a recipe.\n___\n## How do I get a recipe?\nWhile many recipes are available for purchase, there are also rare recipes that can be found through alternative means. With a bit of luck and determination, these coveted recipes can be yours to utilize within the Alchemy System. To access the Alchemy System and purchase valuable recipes, you must locate the esteemed **Master of Alchemy Ruboru** in Flarine, close to the post office.

This approach is relatively slow but can be effective for those who prefer a steady and methodical progression. By completing quests and gathering specific items, you can steadily increase your alchemy skill over time.\n2. [**Alchemy Battery**](../guides/collectorfield.html)**and Darkon 3 Quest Items (Medium)**: Another option is to utilize the Alchemy Battery to acquire Darkon 3 Quest Items, which can then be used to craft potions. This method provides a moderate pace of leveling, offering a balance between effort and reward. By efficiently utilizing the Alchemy Battery and completing Darkon 3 quests, you can steadily progress your alchemy skill without overwhelming expenses.\n3. **Mass Production of EXP-Potions for Seeds (Fast but Expensive)**: The fastest method involves mass-producing EXP-Potions for Seeds. While this approach allows for rapid leveling of your alchemy skill, it comes at a higher cost. Players opting for this method should be prepared to invest a significant amount of resources into acquiring the necessary ingredients for mass production. Despite its expense, this method offers a swift path to leveling up your alchemy skill for those willing to invest in it.\nChoose the method that best suits your playstyle, considering factors such as time commitment, resource availability, and personal preferences. Whether you prefer a steady pace of progression or are willing to invest in faster results, there\u0027s a leveling method tailored to your needs in the world of alchemy.\"\n___\n## How do I get the Alchemy Buff?\nUpon reaching **Alchemy level 25**, players unlock the \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FEOFvZBX9zjQMriIRiuib%252Fbuff_alchemy_max.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da3db607c-0a87-441b-b8f3-342f24dd874c\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=f3b48602\u0026sv=2\n **Alchemy Buff**, providing a significant advantage in potion crafting and related activities. It\u0027s worth noting, however, that Alchemy Level 30 is the highest achievable level in this skill tree.\nWhile aspiring alchemists may aim for the ultimate milestone of Alchemy Level 30, it\u0027s important to understand that this final tier doesn\u0027t offer additional buffs beyond what is gained at Alchemy Level 25. Essentially, the buffs remain consistent once you attain Alchemy Level 25, even as you progress further to reach the maximum level of 30.\nPlayers should strategize their approach to leveling accordingly, considering whether the additional effort required to reach Alchemy Level 30 aligns with their goals and priorities within the game.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FymU5oKy8JNsSfI7spHIx%252FAlchemyBuff.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D13f3483c-3f39-4084-b2bd-4d30f14bea50\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=e8de861b\u0026sv=2\n___\n## Is there a List of the Recipes?\nClick on this link below to access a comprehensive list of all the recipes available in the game.\n\n[Click here to view the complete list of all recipes and their corresponding requirements!](https://imgur.com/a/2EDccXb)",

This system ensures that your character remains optimized for performance by automatically reactivating your power-ups the moment they expire. Below is a detailed guide on how the system works and how to utilize it effectively.\n___\n## How the Auto Power Up System Works\n1. **Preparation:**Gather the power-ups you wish to automate. These can range from buffs that enhance your character\u0027s stats to those that provide specific abilities or advantages during gameplay.\n2. **Activation:**Open the Auto Power Up System interface by following the navigation path:Start \u003e Features \u003e Auto Power Ups.\n3. **Setting Up:**Within the interface, you\u0027ll find a designated window where you can manage your power-ups.

By checking these boxes, you activate the auto-replenishment feature for each respective power-up.

This ensures your character remains at peak performance where it matters most.\n***Manage Your Inventory:**Keep an eye on your inventory of power-ups to ensure that the Auto Power Up System can continue to function without interruption. Running out of essential power-ups could leave your character at a disadvantage at critical moments.\n***Balance Your Power-Ups:**While automating, consider the balance of your power-ups. Relying too heavily on one aspect of your character\u0027s abilities might leave other areas lacking. A well-rounded approach to power-up automation can provide a more versatile and resilient character.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Auto Power Up System is a significant quality-of-life feature that allows players to maintain their competitive edge with minimal effort. By automating the replenishment of power-ups, players can focus more on the strategic and enjoyable aspects of gameplay rather than micromanaging their character\u0027s buffs. Remember to keep your power-up inventory stocked and prioritize the power-ups that best suit your gameplay style and objectives.****",

This section of the Black Market is designed to offer a controlled, competitive environment for acquiring rare and valuable items. Here\u0027s how to navigate and make the most out of the Server-side Black Market.\n___\n## How the Server-side Black Market Works\n1. **Item Listings:**The Server Admin is tasked with listing different items on the Black Market. These items can range from common to rare, each with its unique value and utility within the game.\n2. **Browsing Period:**Once the Black Market session begins, players are given a 5-minute window to browse through the available items. This period is crucial for planning your bidding strategy and deciding which items you wish to pursue.\n3. **Bidding Process:**After the browsing period, the bidding phase commences. Players can start placing their bids on items of interest. The bidding process is competitive, requiring strategic thinking and timely decision-making.\n___\n## Bidding Requirements and Rules\n***Currency Types:**Items on the Server-side Black Market may require different types of currency for bidding, including ECP, Perin, or even specific items like Black Market Coupons. Black Market Coupons can be acquired from the Vote Shop, adding another layer of strategy to acquiring and using resources effectively.\n***Minimum Bid Increase:**To place a bid on an item, your offer must be at least 10% higher than the current highest bid. For example, if the current bid on an item is 800 Perin, a new bid must be at least 880 Perin to overtake the highest bidder position.\n***Winning Bids:**The highest bidder at the end of the bidding timer, displayed alongside the item, wins the item. The won items are directly transferred to the player\u0027s inventory.\n***Outbid Mechanism:**If you are outbid by another player, the currency or items you offered are immediately returned to your inventory. This ensures you can quickly react and place new bids if desired.\n___\n## Handling Full Inventories\n* In cases where your inventory is full at the time of winning an item, the Black Market system ensures you don\u0027t lose out on your winnings. Instead, the items are sent to you via the in-game post system, safeguarding your acquisitions until you can make space in your inventory.\n___\n## Tips for Success in the Server-side Black Market\n***Prepare in Advance:**Ensure you have the necessary currencies and items (like Black Market Coupons) ready before the market opens. This preparation allows you to bid without delays, increasing your chances of winning desired items.\n***Inventory Management:**Keep your inventory as clear as possible before participating in the bidding process. This precaution prevents any delays in receiving won items, especially in the heat of competitive bidding.\n***Stay Alert:**The bidding process can be fast-paced. Stay attentive to bid increments and the remaining time on items to adjust your strategy in real-time.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Server-side Black Market offers a thrilling and strategic avenue for players to acquire unique items through a competitive bidding system. By understanding the rules, preparing appropriately, and engaging actively in the bidding process, players can enhance their gaming experience with valuable acquisitions, all while engaging in the vibrant economy of the game\u0027s community.",

This intuitive interface makes it easy to manage which items you want to sell.\n2. **Setting the Price:**When listing an item, you\u0027ll specify the type of currency you wish to receive (e.g., Perin, ECP, or specific items like Black Market Coupons) and the minimum amount you are willing to accept. This flexibility allows sellers to tailor their sales strategy according to the current market dynamics and their personal goals.\n3. **Activation Fee:**To activate your listing on the Player-side Black Market, a small fee in Perin is required. This fee is a minor investment that enables access to the market\u0027s wide audience of potential buyers.\n___\n## Bidding and Sales Process\n***Bidding Rules:**The bidding process on the Player-side Black Market follows the same rules as the Server-side Black Market. Bidders must offer at least 10% more than the previous bid to participate, ensuring a fair and competitive environment for both buyers and sellers.\n***Successful Sales:**Once a bid meets or exceeds your minimum set price, and the bidding time expires, the sale is completed. The currency or items bid by the buyer are transferred to you, and the sold item is transferred to the buyer\u0027s inventory.\n***Unsuccessful Listings:**If no bids are received by the time the listing period ends, the item is automatically returned to your inventory. This system ensures that you retain possession of your items in the absence of a successful sale, allowing you to relist the item at a later time or adjust your pricing strategy.\n___\n## Tips for Effective Selling on the Player-side Black Market\n***Market Research:**Before listing an item, conduct some research on current market prices and demand. This insight can help you set a competitive and realistic starting price for your items.\n***Clear Inventory Space:**Ensure you have enough space in your inventory before the sale concludes. This preparation prevents any issues with receiving the payment or returning the item if the sale is not successful.\n***Strategic Pricing:**Consider starting with a slightly lower minimum bid to attract more bidders. A competitive starting price can lead to a bidding war, potentially resulting in a higher final sale price.\n***Stay Active:**Keep an eye on your listings and the market activity. Being responsive and adjusting your sales strategy based on market trends can increase your success rate on the Player-side Black Market.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Player-side Black Market is a dynamic and user-friendly platform that enhances the trading experience by putting the power directly in the hands of the players. By understanding how to effectively list, price, and manage your sales, you can maximize your profits and participate actively in the game\u0027s economy.

These stones can primarily be found in:\n***Kingdom Heaven of Madrigal Dungeon:**This dungeon is a rich source of Infinity Stones, offering a higher chance of obtaining them.\n***Older Dungeons:**While the focus may be on the Kingdom Heaven, don\u0027t overlook the older dungeons. They still hold a chance to drop these coveted stones, albeit at a lower rate.\nTo streamline your hunt for Infinity Stones, consult the Droplist available from the Teleporter. This resource will guide you on where to focus your efforts to maximize your chances of finding the stones.\n___\n## Stone Effects: A Gamble with Great Rewards\nUpon securing an Infinity Stone, its application within the Infinity Grid reveals its true potential. Each stone can bestow upon you 1 to 5 random effects, adding a layer of strategy and anticipation to their use. The beauty of this system lies in its flexibility; if the outcomes don\u0027t align with your expectations or needs, you have the option to remove the stones and reapply them, hoping for a more favorable set of effects.\n___\n## Practical Example: The Madrigal Stone (Duplicate)\nTo illustrate, let\u0027s consider the placement of a Madrigal Stone (Duplicate) within a slot of the Infinity Grid. The effects you might receive from this action are varied, demonstrating the system\u0027s random nature and potential for customization. For instance, you could end up with:\n* 3x STR+1\n* 5x STR+1\n* 2x INT+1, 1x Speed+1%, and DEX+2\nThis variability ensures that each player\u0027s experience with the Infinity Grid is unique, offering a personalized approach to character enhancement. The strategic removal and reapplication of stones for different outcomes encourage experimentation and optimization of your character\u0027s capabilities.\n___\n## Embracing the Infinity Grid\u0027s Potential\nThe journey through Madrigal is fraught with challenges and adversaries, but the Infinity Grid and its stones offer a path to surmounting these obstacles. By understanding where to find Infinity Stones and how to best utilize their effects, you\u0027re well-equipped to tailor your character\u0027s development to your playing style, ensuring that each adventure is as rewarding as it is exhilarating.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FHoxUwzOnJOUt8xtoRKK9%252FStones.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd673c6a2-7621-463f-a950-85d687519acc\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=7eb2c631\u0026sv=2",

However, your items will only be listed for sale if you have the VIP Shop Status activated through the Item Buff.\nThe VIP Shop System expands upon the standard Vendor Shop System. Without VIP status, offline vendors are not listed in the Shop Search and can only be placed in Saint Morning. The VIP system offers:\n***Visibility in**[**Shop Search**](../qol-changes/shop-search.html): Your shop will appear in search results.\n***Flexible Placement**: Set up your shop in almost any location.\n***Multiple Shops**: Place up to 3 identical shop clones in different locations for increased visibility and reach.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FCp05Or5KH4fdtGAfGWMA%252FpMTYkDA_d.webp%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dbbe7743f-197e-4622-99c7-c8128214a087\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=f5000b89\u0026sv=2\nAdditionally, when you have the VIP Shop Status active, you can enhance your Main Vendor by right-clicking on it to add cosmetic shop effects.\n___\n## Why the VIP Shop System?\nSince recent updates, acquiring VIP Shop Status has become more accessible through various methods, including farming. Here\u0027s how you can obtain it:\n***Alchemy Recipes**: Visit the Alchemy NPC located in Flarine, close to the Postbox/Bank-NPC. Here, you can use alchemy recipes that require quest items farmed from across Madrigal.\n***Alternative Late-Game Methods**: VIP Shop Status can also be obtained through specific late-game activities.\n***Guild Siege Participation**: Engaging in the Guild Siege events offers another pathway to earning VIP status.\n***Nitro Boosts and Events**: Monthly distributions from Nitro Boosts, alongside different events, provide additional opportunities to gain VIP Shop Status.\n***Future Possibilities**: We\u0027re exploring more ways to integrate VIP status acquisition into various aspects of the game, so stay tuned for future updates!\n***Premium Shop:**Additionally, VIP Shop Status can be directly purchased for 1500 Red Diamonds from the in-game Premium Shop!\nThis approach ensures that players have multiple avenues to achieve VIP Shop Status, enhancing their in-game experience and market participation.\n\nThe introduction of the VIP Shop System, requiring a 1500 Red Diamond fee, was a strategic decision aimed at addressing market dynamics rather than profit-making. Its implementation has:\n***Reduced Market Exploitation**: Diminished the prevalence of free shop-searching for quick Penya, stabilizing market prices.\n***Encouraged Fair Trading**: Players can now sell items at higher prices, contributing to a more stable economy.\n***Alternative Earning Methods**: Players can obtain VIP status through in-game activities like Battleground, Rumble, or Penya farming, without mandatory payment.\n***Maintained Market Activity**: Items in non-VIP shops continue to sell, proving the system\u0027s effectiveness in balancing the game\u0027s economy.\n___\n### Managing Your Sales and Vendor\n___\n### Locating Your Perins\nSold and unsold items, along with the earned Perins, are deposited in the Shop Bank. Access it via **Start -\u003e Shop -\u003e Shop Bank**. In rare cases, you might need to close your shop to retrieve your items.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fw1AOsDeBtVPG1CrzCTIb%252F300px-ShopbankX.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3De49f92f9-98ac-4f5c-be28-093bb55e2228\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=427d35db\u0026sv=2\n___\n### Closing Your Vendor\nTo close your vendor, simply right-click on the shop. Your items will then move to the Shop Bank, where you can reclaim them into your inventory.\nThis guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of our Vendor System, Shop Bank, and VIP Shop System, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable trading experience for all players.

This system provides a way to change how an item or pet looks without affecting its stats or functionalities. It\u0027s important to note, however, that changes made through this system are permanent unless specific recovery actions are taken. For those looking to make reversible changes or save models for future use, a Wardrobe Token is required, which is detailed in our [Wardrobe System Guide](wardrobe-system.html).\n___\n## Requirements\nTo utilize the Modelchange System, you will need:\n1. **Scroll of Modelchange**: This scroll initiates the model change process.\n___\n## Obtaining the Scroll\n***Scroll of Modelchange**: This can be acquired at the Entropia Chip NPC for 1000 Entropia Chips.\n___\n## How to Use the Modelchange System\nTo change the appearance of your item or pet, follow these steps:\n1. **Open the Scroll of Modelchange**: This prepares the system for your model change.\n2. **Select the Primary Item**: Identify the weapon, item, or pet whose functionality you wish to retain. Its stats will remain untouched.\n3. **Choose the Sacrificial Item**: Select the model whose appearance you want to apply to your primary item. Note that the sacrificial item will be permanently removed from your inventory after the process.\n4. **Confirmation**: Click the \"OK\" button to finalize your choice and complete the model change.\nOnce these steps are completed, your primary item or pet will adopt the new appearance, and the sacrificial item will no longer be available.\n___\n## Reverting Changes\nTo revert changes made through the Modelchange System, a **Modelchange Recovery Scroll** is necessary. However, it\u0027s crucial to understand that this scroll does not restore the sacrificial item used in the model change process. Instead, it reverts the appearance of the primary item to its original state.\n***Modelchange Recovery Scroll**: Purchaseable at the Entropia Chip NPC for 500 Entropia Chips.\n___\n## Restore Items from a Model Change\nItems that were not modeled in the Wardrobe can be restored to their original form by purchasing the **\"Scroll of Model Recovery\"** from the Vote Shop, which you can find in the Premium Shop, for 2,000 Vote Points and applying it to the item you wish to revert back to its pre-modeled state.\n___\n## Important Considerations\n***Permanent Changes**: The Modelchange System does not save the original model for later use. To revert to the original appearance, the Modelchange Recovery Scroll is required. However, this scroll will not restore the sacrificial item to your inventory.\n***Wardrobe Token**: If you wish to save the model permanently for future use, a Wardrobe Token is necessary. This option provides more flexibility by allowing changes to be reversible. For more information on how to use a Wardrobe Token, refer to our[Wardrobe System Guide](wardrobe-system.html).\n***No Refunds**: Be aware that items used in the Modelchange System, including the sacrificial item and scrolls, are not refundable. Ensure you are certain of your decisions before proceeding with the model change.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Modelchange System offers players a unique way to customize their gaming experience by altering the appearance of their gear or pets. While it provides a means to personalize your in-game look, it\u0027s essential to plan carefully due to the permanence of these changes. For those seeking more flexibility, the Wardrobe System, accessible with a Wardrobe Token, might be a more suitable option.",

Please note that the items used in the process won\u0027t be refunded. **Please note that an item will not be restored as an item if you saved it in your wardrobe, it will just be removed if you apply this Scroll on a Item with a Wardrobe Model Skin.\n\nRestoration is only possible if a Modelchange was performed without a Wardrobe Token.**\n___\n## Additional Notes\n***Pet Models**: The system also supports changes for pets, but you\u0027ll need specific scrolls for pets, which can be purchased at Wafor. However,Stat Pet Skins cannot be modified through the Wardrobe System due to coding limitations.\n***No Refunds**: Remember, once you use your items in the Wardrobe System, they cannot be refunded. Plan your customizations carefully.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Wardrobe System offers a fantastic way to customize your gaming experience, allowing for a unique personal touch to your character and gear.

These rewards are crucial for upgrading your equipment and enhancing your overall gameplay experience. This guide provides an overview of how to access World Bosses, the rewards system, spawn times, and additional considerations for specific bosses.\n___\n### Accessing World Bosses\nPlayers can quickly teleport to World Boss locations using the [teleport function (Hotkey: V)](../qol-changes/teleporter.html). This feature ensures that players can join the battle effortlessly, focusing on strategy and combat rather than navigation.\n___\n### Rewards\nEngaging with a World Boss and dealing damage makes you eligible for rewards. These rewards play a significant role in advancing your character\u0027s strength and abilities. Participation is key, as it increases your chances of obtaining high-tier loot.\n___\n### Spawn Times and Locations\nWorld Bosses follow specific spawn schedules. Below is a detailed table of their spawn times, including notes on additional random spawns for certain bosses.\nWorld Boss\nFixed Spawn Times\nAdditional Random Spawns\nClockworks\n08:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nEntropia King\n06:30 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nBig Muscle\n08:00 AM - UTC+2\nN/A\nGreat Venux Tree\n03:00 PM - 11:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nProject C-A01\n03:00 PM - 11:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nKrrr\n03:00 AM - UTC+2\nN/A\nMushmoot\n07:00 PM - UTC+2\nN/A\nRoyal Knight\n08:15 PM - UTC+2\n1x Random Spawn between 10AM - 11PM - UTC+2\n___\n#### Special Consideration: Great Venux Tree\nThe Great Venux Tree is located within a PvP (Player vs. Player) Zone. This adds an extra layer of challenge and risk, as other players can attack you during the battle. Moreover, if you are carrying Venux Quest Items in your inventory and are killed by another player, you will lose those items to your assailant. Exercise caution when planning to engage the Great Venux Tree:\n***Prepare for PvP**: In addition to preparing for the World Boss, ensure you are ready for potential player encounters.\n***Secure Your Items**: Consider storing Venux Quest Items or other valuable items before heading into the PvP Zone to minimize losses.\n***Team Up**: Having allies can significantly reduce the risk of being targeted by other players.\n___\n### Strategy Tips\n***Preparation is Key**: Ensure your gear is in top condition and that you have enough potions and buffs for the fight.\n***Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: Collaborate with other players to effectively manage the boss\u0027s health and attacks. Utilizing different roles (tank, DPS, healer) is crucial.\n***Stay Alert**: Pay attention to the boss\u0027s attack patterns and avoid AoE abilities that can be devastating.\n___\n### Conclusion\nThe World Boss System offers a unique and rewarding challenge, providing players with the chance to obtain valuable loot and experience intense combat scenarios. By understanding the spawn times, preparing adequately, and being mindful of the additional risks in certain locations, such as the PvP zone around the Great Venux Tree, players can maximize their chances of success. Teamwork, strategy, and preparation are your best tools in conquering these formidable foes.",

This Pickaxe can also be upgraded using the same method, requiring only the necessary Farm Material to grant it EXP for its advancement. An upgraded Pickaxe brings significant benefits, such as the ability to mine ores more quickly or to gather a larger quantity of ores with each mining attempt. This enhancement makes the Pickaxe an essential tool for those looking to optimize their mining efficiency and increase their ore collection rate.\nIcon\nOre

The Standard Bait \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FbODMimrW6Q7YtwYTZgHR%252Flpu4fAP%2520-%2520Imgur-Photoroom.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D05a6c097-ea6f-482d-a39e-c23685711e5d\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=9403e924\u0026sv=2\n, the Anchovy Bait \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fc8DcHELSmOvejRB8WuC2%252Fimage-Photoroom.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D4c877267-fbbc-49b4-9a9d-01845d2a5968\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=51bd683a\u0026sv=2\n, the Black Anchovy Bait\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FgEATMVCzZ7iWkH8c7o7V%252Fzk4n7TE%2520-%2520Imgur-Photoroom.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dfd4a721e-55ed-442e-a353-3c8f17fcf991\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=c01bb848\u0026sv=2\n, the Fly Bait \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FCx4cxlix8njPcbjWsIdP%252Fimage-Photoroom.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D65fc1fd7-da62-4c44-9144-1e6dc20663d0\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=5471d453\u0026sv=2\nand the Gold Bait\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FxUN6ECOeW4qMCtws3GgX%252Fimage-Photoroom%2520%281%29.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D44540444-288d-41ab-8df2-5c7f4015e4fb\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=8eb4f6c8\u0026sv=2\n.\n___\n## How do I fish?\nThat’s very easy! Get close to a sea or any body of water and click the symbol near your character. Your character will start fishing. If you catch a fish, another window will open. In this window, you need to click on the fish inside the inner circle. Be careful not to click on the bombs!

This system allows players to transform their existing cards into more powerful versions, thereby augmenting their equipment\u0027s effectiveness. Below is a detailed guide on how the Card Upgrade System works, including the process of upgrading cards, the resources required, and where to find the necessary NPCs.\n___\n### Overview\nUpgrading cards is a strategic process that involves combining multiple cards of the same type along with specific items called Destruction Prevention Scrolls. This process not only requires a collection of cards but also a financial investment in the form of Perin, the game\u0027s currency, and a considerable amount of patience and luck.\n___\n#### Key Components\n***Cards**: 10 cards of the same type are required for each upgrade attempt.\n***Destruction Prevention Scrolls**: These scrolls are essential to prevent the cards from being destroyed during the upgrade process.\n***Perin**: A small amount of this currency is needed for each upgrade attempt.\n___\n### Obtaining Resources\n* [**Destruction Prevention Scrolls**](../custom-content/other/rhisis-trail.html): These can be a challenge to acquire due to their high demand and cost. Players can exchange 750 Entropia Chips for these scrolls at the Card Manager, making it a crucial step in gathering the necessary resources for upgrading.\n***Entropia Chips**: Typically earned through various in-game activities, these chips serve as a valuable currency for obtaining essential items like the Destruction Prevention Scrolls.\n___\n### How to Upgrade Cards\n1. **Locate a Card Manager**: Visit Saint City or other designated locations to find a Card Manager NPC.\n2. **Prepare Your Cards**: Place 10 cards of the same type into the upgrade window provided by the Card Manager.\n3. **Add a Destruction Prevention Scroll**: Include one of these scrolls to ensure your cards are not destroyed if the upgrade attempt fails.\n4. **Pay the Fee**: Submit the required amount of Perin to proceed with the upgrade attempt.\n___\n#### Upgrade Path\n***From S-Cards to R-Cards**: Combining 10 S-Cards with the necessary resources can potentially upgrade them to 1 R-Card. This principle applies to upgrading 10% cards to 12% cards.\n***From R-Cards to Z-Cards**: Similarly, 10 R-Cards can be upgraded to 1 Z-Card, akin to upgrading 12% cards to 15% cards.\n___\n### Tips for Successful Upgrades\n***Resource Management**: Ensure you have enough Entropia Chips and Perin before attempting upgrades. It\u0027s crucial to manage these resources wisely to sustain your upgrade efforts.\n***Patience is Key**: The upgrade process can be based on chance, so patience and persistence are essential. Not every attempt will be successful, but perseverance can lead to significant improvements in your equipment\u0027s power.\n***Strategic Planning**: Consider which cards to upgrade based on your current equipment and gameplay needs. Prioritizing upgrades that offer the most immediate benefits can enhance your overall performance in the game.",

This guide will explain how to use the scroll effectively to upgrade your items.\n___\n## Understanding the Scroll\nThe [Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Equipment/Weapon)](../../custom-content/black/kebaria.html) is designed to increase the bonus stats of your items, such as STR on a helmet or any other attribute relevant to your equipment or weapon. It\u0027s particularly useful for players looking to maximize the potential of their gear.\n___\n## How It Works\n1. **Identify Your Target Item**: Start with an item that has a bonus you wish to improve, for example, a[Black Slayer Helmet](../../custom-content/black/kebaria/magma-cave.html)with a bonus of 20 STR.\n2. **Find a Compatible Item**: Obtain another Black Slayer Helmet that is either destroyed or[merged](../../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system.html). It\u0027s crucial that this item is of the same class and part, and it must have the same stat but a higher value than your current item.\n3. **Prepare to Use the Scroll**: Double-click on the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll to activate it. You will then need to place the item with the higher stat on the left side of the upgrade window and the item with the lower stat on the right side.\n4. **Execute the Upgrade**: Click on the arrow in the middle of the Scroll window. The process will destroy the item with the higher stat, transferring its superior stat to the item with the lower stat.\n___\n## Important Notes\n***Item Destruction**: Be aware that the item placed on the left side of the upgrade window will be destroyed in the process. Ensure you\u0027re willing to sacrifice this item to enhance your target item.\n***Stat Compatibility**: This scroll allows for flexibility in upgrading stats across different item types, such as upgrading the stats of a 1on1 Knuckle with an HP Knuckle, provided they are compatible in terms of class and part.\nThis scroll allows you to increase your bonus on your already [merged](../../sets-weapons-and-items/merge-system.html)item.\n**NOTE: You can upgrade the stats of a 1on1 Knuckle, with HP Knuckle.\nNOTE: The item on the left side will be destroyed.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FWLzV8IUkA9qpfnzU3cNW%252FUpgradeScrollEW.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D8741a169-a1eb-4930-b356-3fe253aae4ed\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=229fd206\u0026sv=2",

This guide will delve into the specifics of using the fusion variant of the scroll, highlighting the differences and steps required to successfully upgrade your weapon fusion.\n___\n## Overview\nWhile the core concept remains the same—upgrading the bonus stats of your items—the application process for the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion) differs slightly to accommodate the nuances of weapon fusion. This scroll is specifically designed to enhance the bonuses on a weapon that has been fused with another.\n___\n## Preparing for Upgrade\n1. **Identify Your Target Fusion**: Start with a weapon fusion that you wish to enhance. For example, if your bow fusion has a main bonus of 20 Critical Damage and the fusion itself has 18 Critical Damage, and you aim to upgrade the fusion to 19 Critical Damage.\n2. **Prepare a New Fusion**: Before using the scroll, you must create a new fusion. Take a bow with 19 Critical Damage and fuse it with a \"crap\" or destroyed black bow. This new fusion will serve as the donor for the upgrade.\n___\n## Using the Scroll\n1. **Activate the Scroll**: Double-click on the Black Shiny Bonus Upgrade Scroll (Weapon Fusion) to bring up the upgrade interface.\n2. **Arrange the Weapons**: In the upgrade window, place the newly created fusion (with the desired higher bonus) on the left side and the original weapon fusion (with the lower bonus) on the right side.\n3. **Execute the Upgrade**: Click the arrow in the middle of the upgrade window to transfer the higher stat from the left-side item to the right-side item. The left-side item, along with its fusion, will be destroyed in the process.\n___\n## Important Notes\n***Item Destruction**: Remember, the item (and its fusion) placed on the left side will be destroyed. Ensure that you are prepared to lose this item as part of the upgrade process.\n***Strategic Fusion**: The process requires creating a new fusion specifically for the upgrade. This means you\u0027ll need an additional weapon with the desired higher bonus and a weapon to serve as the base for the fusion, which will ultimately be destroyed.**NOTE: The item on the left side will be destroyed.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FuiRFwWe8xshAWtG66W5d%252FUpgradeScroxDllF.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1771e313-7551-419a-9793-7617fe4191a2\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=8bd228c1\u0026sv=2",

This guide will explain the process of using the Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scrolls, highlighting the key differences and steps involved in upgrading your Soulreaver items.\n___\n## Overview\nSoulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scrolls are designed to enhance the bonuses on Soulreaver items, which are typically more potent and require a specific approach to upgrade. The process involves merging and unmerged items, with a focus on matching the stats for a successful upgrade.\n___\n## Key Differences\n***Target Items**: These scrolls are exclusively used for Soulreaver items, which must have undergone a merging process to be eligible for an upgrade.\n***Stat Requirements**: The item used to enhance the merged Soulreaver item must be unmerged and possess equivalent stats to ensure compatibility.\n___\n## Upgrading Process\n1. **Prepare Your Soulreaver Item**: Identify the Soulreaver item (either equipment or weapon) that you wish to upgrade. This item must have already been merged to qualify for the upgrade process.\n2. **Select an Unmerged Item**: Find an unmerged Soulreaver item with the desired higher bonus stats. This item will be used to upgrade the bonuses on your merged Soulreaver item.\n3. **Initiate the Upgrade**: Activate the Soulreaver Bonus Upgrade Scroll by double-clicking on it. In the upgrade window, place the unmerged item with the higher bonus on the left side and the merged Soulreaver item on the right side.\n4. **Complete the Upgrade**: Proceed with the upgrade by clicking the arrow in the middle of the upgrade window. The unmerged item on the left will be consumed in the process, transferring its higher stats to the merged item on the right.\n___\n## Important Considerations\n***Item Destruction**: The unmerged Soulreaver item placed on the left side of the upgrade window will be destroyed. Ensure you are willing to sacrifice this item for the sake of enhancing your merged Soulreaver item.\n***Stat Matching**: It\u0027s crucial that the unmerged item used for the upgrade has equivalent or higher stats than the merged item to ensure a successful upgrade.\n***Upgrade Limitations**: While it is possible to upgrade both the black bonus and the Soulreaver bonus, the process requires an unmerged Soulreaver item with the appropriate stats for each bonus you wish to enhance.\n**Please take note: The item on the left-hand side shall be rendered inoperable during the upgrade process.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FzwYqAPVeF900H0JYIyjb%252FUpgradeScrollEWSR.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da4e9b820-9ef9-46f0-92e5-3e7999645951\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=4e54046\u0026sv=2",

This guide will delve into the specifics of how to use the Bonus Transfer Card effectively, focusing on its application for black or Soulreaver items.\n___\n## Overview\nThe Bonus Transfer Card offers a unique opportunity to upgrade your equipment by transferring bonuses from one item to another. This process is crucial for optimizing your gear\u0027s performance in various game scenarios. However, there are specific conditions and limitations to be aware of before proceeding with the bonus transfer.\n___\n## Key Conditions\n***Item Type Restriction**: The transfer of bonuses can only occur between items of the same type. For example, a bonus from a weapon cannot be transferred to a suit, and vice versa.\n***Bonus Variability**: The specific bonus being transferred does not need to match between the two items. This means you can transfer different types of bonuses as long as the items are of the same type.\n___\n## Using the Bonus Transfer Card\n1. **Select Your Items**: Identify the two items you wish to use in the transfer process. Ensure both items are either black or Soulreaver items and of the same type (e.g., two weapons or two suits).\n2. **Prepare for the Transfer**: Place the item with the desired bonus to transfer on the left side of the transfer window. This item will be the source of the bonus. Place the item you wish to upgrade on the right side.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Bonus Transfer Card by double-clicking on it and proceed with the transfer by confirming the action. The item on the left side, which is the source of the bonus, will be destroyed in the process, and its bonus will be transferred to the item on the right side.\n___\n## Important Considerations\n***Item Destruction**: Be fully aware that the item placed on the left side of the transfer window will be consumed and destroyed during the bonus transfer process. This is a permanent action, and the item cannot be recovered.\n***Strategic Selection**: Given the irreversible nature of the bonus transfer, it\u0027s crucial to carefully select which bonus to transfer and to which item. Consider the overall impact on your gear setup and gameplay strategy.\n**Please keep in mind that the item on the left side will be destroyed in the process.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FqJniDMA9aEO4sDGDfKWN%252FTransferCard2.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7ac98a67-5275-483b-99bd-152f98a0f06f\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=b21041b\u0026sv=2",

This means players can now transfer one (for black items) or two (for Soulreaver items) fusion bonuses from one item to a similar item, enhancing the versatility and strategic depth of gear customization.\n___\n## Key Features\n***Fusion Bonus Transfer**: Specifically designed to transfer fusion bonuses between two items of the same type.\n***Compatibility**: Works with both black and Soulreaver items, allowing the transfer of one or two fusion bonuses, respectively.\n***Type Restriction**: Bonuses can only be transferred between items of the same type (e.g., weapon to weapon, suit to suit).\n___\n## How to Use the Bonus Transfer Card (Fusion)\n1. **Prepare Your Items**: Identify the two items you wish to use. Both should be of the same type and either black or Soulreaver items. The item from which the bonus will be transferred should already have the desired bonus as a fusion.\n2. **Set Up the Fusion**: Before using the card, ensure that the item receiving the bonus has been properly fused. This means placing the item with the desired bonus as a fusion into another item, preparing it for the bonus transfer.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Bonus Transfer Card (Fusion) by double-clicking on it. In the transfer window, place the fused item with the bonus on the left side and the item to receive the bonus on the right side.\n4. **Complete the Transfer**: Confirm the transfer process. The item on the left side, which is the source of the fusion bonus, will be destroyed, and its fusion bonus will be transferred to the item on the right side.\n___\n## Important Considerations\n***Item Destruction**: The source item (placed on the left side) will be consumed and destroyed in the process. This is irreversible, so ensure you are prepared to lose this item.\n***Strategic Planning**: Given the permanent nature of this transfer, carefully consider which bonuses to transfer and to which items.

This feature provides a level of flexibility and customization previously unattainable, allowing for strategic enhancements to a player\u0027s gear.

The Awake Transfer Card revolutionizes gear customization by allowing these bonuses to be transferred between items, offering players the opportunity to optimize their equipment setup according to their strategic needs.\n___\n## Key Features\n***Cross-Class Transferability**: Awakes can be transferred between items of any class, such as from one suit to another or between different types of weapons.\n***Fusion Transfer**: If the original item has a fusion, this fusion (along with its awake) will be transferred to the new item.\n***Fusion Awake Limitation**: When transferring an awake between items of different types (e.g., from a bow to an axe), be aware that the fusion awake will not carry over and will disappear.\n___\n## How to Use the Awake Transfer Card\n1. **Select Your Items**: Identify the item with the desired awake you wish to transfer and the target item to receive the awake. Remember, the transfer can occur between any types of items.\n2. **Prepare for Transfer**: Ensure that both the source item (the one with the awake you wish to transfer) and the target item (the one to receive the awake) are correctly selected and ready for the process.\n3. **Initiate the Transfer**: Activate the Awake Transfer Card by double-clicking on it. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the source item and the target item for the awake transfer.\n4. **Complete the Transfer**: Confirm the transfer. The awake (and any associated fusion) from the source item will now be transferred to the target item. If transferring between different item types, remember that the fusion awake will not be transferred and will be lost.\n___\n## Important Considerations\n***Strategic Use**: Given the potential loss of fusion awakes when transferring between different item types, it\u0027s crucial to plan your awake transfers strategically. Consider the benefits of the awake versus the potential loss of fusion bonuses.\n***Optimization**: Use the Awake Transfer Card to optimize your gear for specific gameplay strategies or to enhance the overall performance of your character.\n**It\u0027s important to remember that the item on the left side of the transfer will be destroyed in the process.**\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fgt46hyiLEmumeGV8KWPP%252FAwakeCard.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Db1646506-f1bf-4b0c-9fe6-521b3bf3f08a\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=3b666c7d\u0026sv=2",

Here\u0027s a detailed look at how the Bonus Slot Recovery Card works and how to use it effectively.\n___\n## Overview\nIn the game, weapons and equipment come with a limited number of rerolls that allow players to optimize the stats of their items.

This card resets the reroll count, giving you additional opportunities to achieve the desired stats on your black or Soulreaver weapons/equipment.\n___\n## Key Features\n***Reroll Restoration**: Restores the reroll attempts of an item back to its maximum capacity (e.g., 0 out of 5 rerolls to 5 out of 5).\n***Multiple Uses**: Can be used multiple times on the same item, offering continuous opportunities for stat optimization.\n***Flexibility**: Provides players with the flexibility to continuously adjust and optimize their equipment\u0027s stats as their strategy or needs change.\n___\n## How to Use the Bonus Slot Recovery Card\n1. **Identify the Item**: Select the black or Soulreaver weapon/equipment that has exhausted all its reroll attempts and needs restoration.\n2. **Activate the Card**: Use the Bonus Slot Recovery Card by double-clicking on it in your inventory. Then, select the item you wish to restore rerolls to.\n3. **Confirm the Restoration**: After selecting the item, confirm the action to restore its reroll attempts.

It\u0027s especially useful for high-value or endgame equipment where optimal stats are crucial.\n***Resource Management**: While the card offers the flexibility to reroll stats multiple times, be mindful of your resources.

Consider consulting guides or experienced players to optimize your point allocation.\n***Regular Review**: As you progress through the game and unlock new abilities or change your play style, regularly review your Infinity Grid allocation to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.\n***Complementary Tools**: Combine the use of the Infinity Crystal Reset Card with other in-game tools and resources to maximize your character\u0027s potential.

Here are some key points to consider:\n***Variety**: There are several types of batteries available, each designed to collect specific items or materials.\n***Obtaining Batteries**: While some batteries are readily available, others may be more challenging to obtain.

This system is currently applicable only to armor pieces (Hat, Suit, Gauntlets, Boots) from the [Shiny](../custom-content/shiny.html), [Black](../custom-content/black.html), and [Soulreaver](../custom-content/soulreaver.html) sets that have bonus values. Here\u0027s how you can leverage this system to boost your character\u0027s PvE capabilities.\n___\n## Creating a Spirit Dice\nTo create a \n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FzaCFfRUBR3GgMMx0uRx4%252Fitem_statwuerfel.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D02d63988-7991-48f5-a0c3-322c0d6362db\u0026width=300\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=a31bf389\u0026sv=2\nSpirit Dice, follow these steps:\n1. **Accessing the System**: Navigate toStart -\u003e Features -\u003e Spirit Diceto open the Spirit Dice creation window.\n2. **Placing Items**: Insert one or two items with bonus values into the window. The system will display the chance of successfully creating a Spirit Dice based on the items\u0027 bonus values.\n___\n## Chance Calculation\n***Maximum Bonus Values**: Items with the highest possible bonus values (e.g., STR+50) provide a base chance of 35% for one item and 60% for two items.\n***Lower Bonus Values**: Items with lower bonus values will have their chance automatically calculated and assigned by the server. For example, an item with STR+25 might have a 15% chance, and two such items would double the chance to 30%.\n**Important**: Once an item is converted into a Spirit Dice, it cannot be restored.\n___\n## Using Spirit Dice\nSpirit Dice are used to grant additional status values to your character, enhancing your PvE performance. Here\u0027s what you need to know:\n***PvE Enhancement**: The additional status values from Spirit Dice are effective only in PvE environments. In PvP areas (with the exception of Venux), these stats do not contribute to your damage.\n***Status Value Increase**: Each successful use of a Spirit Dice can increase a status value (STR, STA, DEX, INT) by +1, with a 35% chance of success per dice.\n***Stat Cap**: Initially, status values can be increased up to +75 using standard Spirit Dice.\n___\n## Viewing Stats\n* To view the stats gained from Spirit Dice, press \"H\" to open the Character Info window.\n___\n## Royal Spirit Dice\nFor those looking to push beyond the initial cap, the Royal Spirit Dice system extends the maximum status value increase to +125.\n***Obtaining Royal Spirit Dice**: These can be acquired through Dungeon Drops, the Exchanger in Cardia, and the Daily Roulette.\n***Usage Strategy**: It\u0027s recommended to use normal Spirit Dice to reach the initial cap of 75 before starting to use Royal Spirit Dice for further enhancements.\n___\n## Conclusion\nThe Spirit Dice System offers a strategic way to utilize armor pieces with less desirable bonus values, turning them into valuable assets for strengthening your character in PvE. By carefully selecting items for conversion and strategically using Spirit Dice, players can significantly enhance their character\u0027s performance over time. Remember, this system is designed for long-term progression, providing a rewarding experience as you continue to develop your character\u0027s capabilities.",

With enough time and patience, players can accumulate a large quantity of both coins and runes, which can be used to craft powerful equipment and items later on.\nIn summary, the Catacombs are a crucial dungeon that players must navigate to progress to the mid-game. With the right gear and strategy, players can farm valuable coins and runes and unlock essential alchemy recipes. So, make sure you\u0027re well-equipped and prepared before entering the Catacombs.\n[You can see the map of Catacombs here.](../../../../files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces/b31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu/uploads/BvO5ECUEkyVJePlaHmLK/400px-Catacombs_of_Anguish_Dungeon_Mapf6a8.png?alt=media\u0026token=72c97085-792f-4af1-a208-2f5bd6a5c64d)\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FeWYs2OxB18GKRPBmbjOH%252Fcata.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D22898811-4678-4cf0-971e-51aa83b7840d\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=e01d7a09\u0026sv=2",

In these dungeons, you will need runes, but they can only be obtained by defeating the end boss. However, you will receive more than three runes at a time, and the number can vary.\nApart from the runes, you can also obtain level 3 beads that will greatly enhance your damage output. Furthermore, you can purchase models and power-ups using the runes from the Wilds Exchanger NPC located outside the dungeon.\nWhile not as critical as some other dungeons, the Wild Dungeons are still worthwhile to explore. The rewards may not be as plentiful, but they can still be quite useful in enhancing your character\u0027s abilities.

Additionally, if you are killed by another player while in Venux, you will lose all of the quest items you have farmed there. It\u0027s important to note that your quest items are not even safe in your bag, but there is a helpful scroll called V**enus Charm (Drop Protection+)** which can prevent you from losing your items if you happen to die.\nFurthermore, it\u0027s important to know that you will not be able to use the Mailbox, Guildbank, or Bank while in the Venux area.

This dungeon is not for the faint of heart and requires careful planning, strategy, and teamwork to defeat the bosses.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FpYkqtlBOnkPKRQoqAIpG%252Fdeeptmpl.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Da8135a71-0f94-4aa8-8af8-4e06c81adad5\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=87d65853\u0026sv=2",

It is known for dropping a plethora of items, mainly Royal Equipment and upgrade items.\nThe dungeon consists of eight minibosses and a final boss, each requiring up to 5.3 million HP to defeat. Due to the intense level of difficulty, players need a strong tank, preferably one with damage absorb capabilities since the damage dealt is extremely high and must be healed. Hybrid tanks are not recommended, as Suckblood is capped at 7,5%. Unless they are significantly well-equipped, they might not be strong enough to handle the dungeon\u0027s challenges.\nIn addition to a sturdy tank, high damage output is also crucial. A minimum requirement for players is to have a perfect SR EQ, but Royal Darkness Equipment is highly recommended for best results. This equipment provides players with the highest damage output and increases their chances of survival in the dungeon.\nOverall, the Destruction Cavern presents a unique and challenging experience for players who are looking for a test of their skills and equipment. However, it is not for the faint-hearted, and players must prepare adequately before attempting to enter the dungeon.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FBHUhVsoKYlRy34ZUv1Bu%252Fdestro.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9fbbdd84-4cde-4bdf-8a95-af4c7356371f\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=a0cc09a0\u0026sv=2",

Shrouded in dense fog, it hid from the world, letting only rumors of its existence seep through to the neighboring ports.\nPirates, attracted by the lure of immense wealth, were drawn to these rumors. Ships filled with rough and rugged seamen set off to discover the island and plunder its treasures. All returned with tales of strange occurrences and mysterious phenomena.\nThe island itself was a bizarre landscape, dominated by a dense, impenetrable jungle called Umbala and crisscrossed by expansive caves overrun by pirates. The trees in the Umbala jungle seemed to whisper and move as if they were alive, emanating an aura of magic and mystery that kept all intruders at bay.\nThe cave, deep beneath the surface of Dread Cove Isle, was a labyrinth of dark passages and rooms. Pirates discovered ancient, saltwater-etched writings on the walls and found chests full of gold and jewels. But with each treasure they lifted from the depths of the cave, they seemed to awaken an even deeper darkness.\nIt was as if the island was resisting its plunderers. The fog grew denser and eerier. The trees in the Umbala jungle seemed even more threatening and the whispering grew louder. Eventually, entire pirate ships disappeared after leaving the island, never reaching their home ports.\nDespite these warnings and mysterious incidents, the wealth hidden on Dread Cove Isle could not deter the pirates. They kept returning, drawn by the prospect of treasures and the mystery surrounding the island.\nThus, Dread Cove Isle remains an island of mystery and danger to this day, its treasures and terrors sought alike by greedy pirates. It is a world full of mysteries and wonders, hidden in a fog of oblivion and legends. Those who dare to uncover its secrets must be prepared to face the consequences that come with the treasures of Dread Cove Isle.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FgLaNanIvEb0V9NYy5wOD%252Fs2WaAwC%2520-%2520Imgur.gif%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1416b9a3-31d6-4140-8c8f-2d4a99c8e223\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=cb71aec9\u0026sv=2",

This is because the Slayer\u0027s kit is designed to excel in single target combat. Unlike other classes that may have more versatile kits or better AoE damage, the Slayer is focused solely on dealing as much damage as possible to a single target.\nHowever, this focus on 1v1 damage comes at a cost. The Slayer has very little AoE damage potential, which makes it difficult for them to take on groups of enemies or clear out large areas quickly. Additionally, the Slayer has low, making them more vulnerable to attacks.\nFurthermore, the Slayer lacks a support kit, which means they are not able to heal or buff allies like other classes such as Priests or Paladins. And while the Slayer can still contribute to group play with their high single target damage, their lack of support abilities can make them less desirable for group content.\nAnother weakness of the Slayer is their farming potential, which is quite low compared to other classes. This is due to the Slayer\u0027s focus on single target damage, which makes it difficult for them to farm large groups of enemies efficiently.\nDespite these weaknesses, the Slayer\u0027s high 1v1 damage output makes them a formidable opponent in PvP and boss fights. However, their hybrid build can tax their damage output, pushing them down to a lower tier of DPS compared to other classes. As a result, Slayers are often placed in the front line of battles, relying on their high damage output to take down enemies quickly before they have a chance to strike back.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252Fmr5WPX8Xoex0PlilNO9v%252FSlayer.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D07153d56-89c4-4ba7-b62b-82bcca06ac5d\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=a9122d46\u0026sv=2",

Similar to the Slayer, the Harlequin lacks good AoE damage and a support kit, but they do not have as low HP as the Slayer. This makes them a decent option for soloing low-tier dungeons, as they have enough HP to withstand enemy attacks while dealing high damage output.\nHowever, just like the Slayer, the Harlequin has little farming potential due to their focus on single target damage. They are not as efficient at clearing out large groups of enemies quickly, which can make it difficult to farm resources and complete quests.\nBecause of their slightly higher HP compared to the Slayer, the Harlequin is able to maintain good survivability while dealing a high amount of damage in 1v1 combat. However, their damage output is slightly lower than that of the Slayer, which is a tradeoff for their improved survivability.\nOverall, the Harlequin is a strong option for players who enjoy dealing high amounts of single target damage and have a preference for solo content. Their ability to survive in combat, combined with their high damage output, makes them a good choice for taking on bosses and other powerful enemies. However, in group content where support and AoE damage are important, the Harlequin may not be the best fit.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252F8YZFgzVjPv2bfOcYrUZw%252Fharlequin.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5031eff0-9fca-49cf-a04f-7fb501d7fcb7\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=becde1d7\u0026sv=2",

His primary strength lies in his ability to obliterate large groups of enemies with ease, making him a sought-after asset in group settings. However, when it comes to 1v1 combat, the Arcanist\u0027s damage output is not as impressive as some of the other classes, which might lead some players to overlook him in favor of other options.\nDespite this, we believe that ranking the Arcanist too low on the list would be a disservice to his unique strengths. His unparalleled AoE damage output more than justifies his position on the list, even if his 1v1 damage is not as high as some of the other classes. To balance out this discrepancy, we decided to upgrade his Bubble Damage, making him more effective in both PvE and PvP combat.\nBy upgrading the Arcanist\u0027s Bubble Damage, we hope to make him a more viable option for players who prefer a more well-rounded character. This upgrade will enable him to deal more damage to single targets, while still retaining his impressive AoE capabilities. In summary, while the Arcanist\u0027s 1v1 damage may not be as strong as some of the other classes, his exceptional AoE damage and well-rounded kit make him a valuable asset in any group setting.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FvXV8Nxpe3A1rgn3vVDqg%252FArcanist.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Ddc77daa2-6cd9-41fe-bc91-ba57c9c1a5ab\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=bab5a48\u0026sv=2",

To build such a tank, it is important to focus on the right equipment, abilities, and attributes.\nFirstly, the tank needs to have high endurance to withstand as much damage as possible. Therefore, all attributes that increase endurance should be maximized. It is also important for the tank to have enough strength to occasionally deal damage and draw the opponent\u0027s attention. Thus, the character\u0027s strength should also be increased.\nIn terms of equipment, it is crucial for the tank to have high defense to absorb damage. A good armor and shield are essential for this. It is also important for the tank to have a weapon that supports their self-healing abilities. A weapon with life-regeneration stats or one that enables healing is a good choice.\nFinally, optimizing the tank\u0027s abilities is essential to increase their survivability. Abilities that reduce damage or heal are particularly important here. Some abilities that improve the tank\u0027s health can also be useful. It is also important to prepare the tank for the use of potions and buffs to quickly respond to difficult battles.\nIn summary, building a Self Sustain Tank requires a strong combination of endurance, defense, strength, self-healing, and tactical gameplay.

If you remove them by double-clicking on them in the Element Change window, the glowstones are completely destroyed.\nThere are eight different types of glowstones.\nAccordingly, we have created 80 new weapon glows and added them to all weapon types.\nThese glowstone items can be traded.\nThe weapon glows can be viewed in the Item Wiki Model Viewer by equipping the corresponding weapon beforehand and then pressing on the corresponding glowstone.\n[img]https://wiki.entropia.top/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2400962713-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fb31Yp1jJXF9fFE5753Pu%252Fuploads%252FFHOVk8dWWSnfkCFVtOp6%252FYEoWbbi%2520-%2520Imgur.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D17cbcd27-762e-48f1-8521-99f21e11ab56\u0026width=400\u0026dpr=1\u0026quality=100\u0026sign=4a4fa38d\u0026sv=2\nAdditionally, we have also introduced approximately 40 new suit glows and hand glows. These can be activated as item buffs for a certain period of time and overwrite your current suit and hand glow.\nThese glows can only be obtained through the Timerun in the Heroic Deep Temple, Destruction Cavern, and Azmore Forest.\nThese items can also be traded.\nYou can view these glows in the Item Wiki Model Viewer by selecting an item as a model beforehand.",
