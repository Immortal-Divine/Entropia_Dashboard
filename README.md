	+ To use this feature your Server must support nickname lists
	+ If you want to login more than 5 different account on your Client, you must add exactly 10 logins to the list
	+ Login will happen automatically and use the login settings of the Dashboard if provided
	+ Default resolution is for 1024x768, if you want to use another size you must set the coordinates for First Nickname and Scroll Down Arrow

+ Select your Client in the Dashboard and click Ftool

	+ To patch all your profiles, you just need to patch with the main launcher. Press Copy Neuz.exe after the patch to complete it for all profiles
	+ All features of the Dashboard are linked with profiles, you don't have to use them. But your expierence will be way better
