Features:

- Process list displays the current running clients in the 
   order they got started.
   Selecting one or more entrys is mandatory for other features. 

- Can start the desired total amount of clients without
   loading errors

- Logs up to 10 clients in and starts collecting. 
   The login takes the # of the process list to log the # of 
   the nickname in the client in. # 4 is nickname # 4 etc.
   Once the login process is completed, it clicks on 'Start' 
   for collecting. Minimal client resolution mandatory.
   This works only for the first 10 clients in the process list.
   If your character is in another slot, change the Login 
   Position in the Settings.
   Mouse movement aborts the login operation.

- Ftool remembers the character it got used on and 
   its settings. Gets pinned to the top left of the window.
   Up to 10 F Keys can be set with a minimum delay
   of 100ms. Multiple Ftools are possible.

- Terminate the selected entrys instantly
